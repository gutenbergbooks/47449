<h2 class="gap4">PREFACE&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vol. VIII.</span></h2>

<p>Everyone who has followed the story of the War in
South Africa from start to finish will assuredly have
acquired a keen and lasting interest in the land which
has been won by the expenditure of so much blood and
treasure. Earnestly will he discuss in his mind all
questions connected with the development of the New Dominions
of the King, and vigilantly will he watch every action of the
Government in regard to them.</p>

<p>In order rightly to estimate the difficulties to be overcome and
the issues to be hoped for, and to follow these questions with complete
apprehension, it is necessary to be familiar with their aspect
in every possible light. To this end, the Editor has invited the
co-operation of various well-known Authorities, each of whom has
kindly contributed his opinion on matters coming within his special
experience.</p>

<p>The Publishers claim, therefore, that in this Volume is collected
the cream of modern thought, furnished at first-hand by those whose
mastery of their subject, and whose interest in the Empire, render
them competent to instruct in the intricacies of the South African
problems, with which for some time to come we must stand face-to-face.
That these writers do not on all points entirely agree is a
matter for congratulation, as readers are thus enabled to view the
political panorama from every reasonable standpoint, and weigh
the pros and cons of their arguments with perspicuity and without
prejudice.</p>

<p>At the present juncture, when Mr. Chamberlain, the greatest of
Colonial Secretaries, is visiting South Africa, the Publishers are
convinced that this Volume is the most valuable book on the new
Colonies that has yet been offered to the Public.</p>

<p>Emigration of white men and women to South Africa&mdash;how
can we best secure this? The abiding difficulty at the
Cape and throughout the states that will form the future
South African Confederation is the colour question. The
&#8220;colour&#8221; is not that of the gold to be found so often in
many places, but the question of the white and the black races
dwelling in the same country.</p>

<p>Dutchman and Englishman will in time form one race. There
is nothing to part them. They are European cousins. They both
come from North Europe. The blood of the Dutchman runs in the
veins of the Englishman. The parent stock of the Dutch gave off
many a swarm wherewith to people the East Anglian shores.
England has been fed and fought by the Dutch since those old days.
We have received many of their sturdy countrymen into London.
Any one who does not know the number and influence of the Dutch
in comparatively recent times in our metropolis should pay a visit to
the Austen Friars, the place where the monks of St. Augustine had
their headquarters in the city, and see the fine old church the Dutch
built, and in which they still worship. We remember well the stiff
battles of Charles II.&#8217;s time. We know the names of Van Tromp
and De Witt as well as any Dutchman. We have learned to respect
our Dutch cousins, both on sea and land.</p>

<p>And their religion? There is nothing there to separate us.
Has the Presbyterian form of religion kept Scotland separate? No,
save in the pride of her ancient history. No Scotsman has any
objection to marry an English lass, especially if she has herself more
than will give both of them something better than oatcake. And
the Dutch Reformed Church is much like the Presbyterian. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
is nothing that can in its tenets form any bar to the mixing of the
British and Dutch people in South Africa. To be sure, a &#8220;nacht-maal&#8221;
is not precisely a Church of England convocation or congress.
It approaches much nearer to a Scottish communion service in
out-of-the-way Highland parishes. There is nothing aggressive or
exclusive in the staid and sober faith of our Dutch friends. And
this being so, Scotsmen especially have intermarried often with the
Boers.</p>

<p>As trustee of a Highland estate, some time ago my consent was
asked to the granting of a leasehold to a Scottish gentleman, who
had returned from the Transvaal. The only objection the lawyer
who asked the question mentioned as existing against this man was
that he was said to have married a native. Some canny objectors
had written a letter saying that this ought to form a bar to any grant
of land to the man, though he had originally come from the district.
Who was the lady? was the next inquiry. Was she a Hottentot
Venus? Did she &#8220;bang her hair&#8221; in too negroid a fashion? Would
she introduce among the dim lights of the North the terrible practices
of her people? Would the quiet village be scandalised by
strange feasts and weird howlings? No, by no means. What was
she, then? Why, nothing but a nice flaxen-haired, rather squab-featured,
but withal comely Boer girl! So she entered into her
Highland possession, had a door &#8220;stoop,&#8221; or something like a bit of
raised verandah flooring put outside the entrance, but found, poor
soul, that it was rather a dripping place of observation in her adopted
climate. Nevertheless, the last news of her is that she is a happy,
&#8220;sonsie&#8221; mother, and has some children, who don&#8217;t speak Dutch as
their common language, but only a few low Dutch words, with very
Highland accent.</p>

<p>But this is said to be only the case where a Scotsman marries a
Boer. There is apparently something in the Scot that makes him
look after his family more carefully than does the average Englishman
or Irishman. It is therefore only the Scot, as it is said, both in
Africa and in Canada, whose children, if he marry one of another
race, do not desert the accents of their forefathers on the paternal
side. As a rule the children become much what the mother is.
I have seen the children of a naval man who had married an Indian
woman on the Pacific Coast become almost like the small fish-eating
savages around them. They were willing to do a little work for a
spurt, and then relapsed into dirt and laziness. So in the north-west
of Canada it is only an Orkney or Aberdeen east-coast Scot who
can keep his family to civilised life, if he marry a Cree or member
of any other Indian tribe. The Frenchman&#8217;s children, by an Indian
mother, take to hunting only. Even with the Scots in Old Canada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the same rule holds good, at least wherever a Celt has married a
French Canadian. There are numbers of families below Quebec,
on the north side of the river St. Lawrence, whose names are
Highland. They are the descendants chiefly of Fraser&#8217;s Highlanders,
one of the regiments employed during the war against the
French in 1748-49. When the soldiers obtained grants of land on
the conclusion of the war they married French-Canadian women.
Their descendants now can seldom speak one word of English or of
Gaelic. They speak nothing but Canadian French patois. It is the
mother&#8217;s influence, with rare exceptions, that tells. So it is in
South Africa. In some districts it is as with Fraser&#8217;s Highlanders,
in Province Quebec. You may visit farm after farm, especially
those whose owners have Irish names, and you will not find any
person in the house, or on the land belonging to the farm, who can
speak a word of either English or Irish! It may be doubted if
there would have been much loyalty taught to any government by
the use of the Erse tongue. The &#8220;Taal&#8221; may inculcate a certain
amount more of respect for paternal and government authority.
Yet if theory distinguishes between Briton and Boer, or Englishman
and Africander, Nature does not, and you find that the
mingling of the races is a practical principle acted on regularly
wherever the races are brought together. We may congratulate
ourselves that this is so. The mixed race will be a magnificent one,
with the size, courage, and tenacity of the Dutch, and the gentleness,
bravery, and power of government and of cohesion of the Britisher.
There are no handsomer women anywhere than there are among the
Dutch ladies of Cape Colony. Many of their sons are sent to
English public schools and universities, and though there are, alas,
only too many who live under British institutions and who do not
become British, there is no reason why, in course of time, they
should not become as good citizens of a British Commonwealth as
have the Vanderbilts and Van Horns and Roosevelts, and many
others of Dutch name and lineage in New York State, for New
York was New Amsterdam, and a very flourishing Dutch colony.
On the banks of the Hudson you may still see thoroughly Dutch
houses, built in the old days. What New Yorker would now change
his nationality, though of Dutch descent? The freedom they have
in the United States their cousins will also have in South Africa.
They will mix with the English, whose language most of them speak
already. They will do so all the more readily as time passes, in that
they can never feel themselves to be anything but the equals of the
British in all save in numbers.</p>

<p>It was for the benefit of the union between England and Scotland
that the Scots won Bannockburn and many another hard fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
besides. They could point to their victories as the English could to
theirs. And so with those of Dutch race at the Cape. They can point
to famous names of good soldiers, who have inflicted defeat on the
best British troops. And for this they will be all the greater friends
hereafter. Unless each partner in business or in marriage can bring
something into the common pot, there is not so happy a sense of
helpfulness and mutual aid given, as there is when this union is
a more equal one. There is another and a most weighty consideration
which will tend to the union of the European races. This is
the common necessity each has to strengthen the other against any
possible predominance of the blacks. The danger in this matter will
arise more in the warmer regions of the north of the future confederation
than in the more temperate south. Time has proved that the
white races can do well in the Cape. They increase rapidly. The
climate is most favourable. The physical character of the races
does not in any way deteriorate. On the contrary, it improves.
They gain, as the Americans say, in &#8220;avoirdupois.&#8221; An &#8220;avoirdupois&#8221;
Dutchman at the Cape, whose ancestors have been &#8220;avoirdupoising&#8221;
there for two centuries, is a better all-round, and very round
man, than is his compatriot in race at home among the canals and
tulip gardens of Holland. But the black holds his own in weight
and in numbers even in the temperate climate of the Cape Colony.
Farther north, where the temperature is hotter, it is certain that he
will be a better man than the white. The only exception to this can be
in the mountain districts, where at high elevations in the plateaus
there is probably a possibility that the white man&#8217;s children may
thrive. In general, however, in all the low ground north of the
Transvaal, and in many districts there, the &#8220;Kaffir&#8221; will be more
favoured by the climate than will be the white invader. The
Europeans will partially subject them, and partially they will remain,
deteriorated in morals, but by no means likely to remain only the
obedient servants that they are expected to be. There are many
who now say that the next big trouble in South Africa will be with
the blacks. This apprehension, if there be any reason in it, is
another incentive for the whites to combine to make settlements
secure and numerous, where they can defy any movement among
the blacks. It is an additional incentive to us in the old land to see
what we may do to make this union of the whites as British in feeling,
as liberty loving, as British institutions can make it. The Boers
in fighting have not lost their freedom. They have only lost one
form of collective and separate independence. Individually their
independence is far better guaranteed under British than under
Dutch Africander forms of government.</p>

<p>But a great help to their seeing and understanding of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
will be the predominance, not the domination, of the English
language. In the schools English history and its modern
expansion in the colonies should be taught. Half of the dislike
of England shown in the Republic and among the people in
the United States arises from the teaching of the school-books,
which indoctrinates the young American with the idea that as all
tyranny known to his American fathers was centralised and
expressed in Lord North&#8217;s Stamp Act and the Tea Duties, so
the modern Britisher must still be imbued with the ideas of Lord
North, and taxation without representation must go hand in hand
with British rule. The young Africander must be taught that
we of the old country have learned our lesson. He must know
that each of the British self-governing colonies is a separate nation
in alliance of its own free will with the mother-land. He must
know that even in the wildest dreams of Africanderism the most
separatist of the separatists desired the naval stations of the Cape to
remain one of the chief resorts of the British fleet. Now that
Germany and France have their foot on South African soil, &#8220;marching&#8221;
with the states of the new confederation to be, the youth of the
states must be taught to know our forms of government and the
history of them, so that they may judge if they would rather be
under the German or French flag. To be under any separate new
flag would of course be to court danger from the powerful countries,
who could cut off their trade from the harbours, were it not for the
protection afforded by the British fleets. Union and education are
therefore the passwords to success.</p>

<p>How can we better help these forces than by well-devised
emigration? Our Dutch friends have given us a good example.
They imported in the eighteenth century 5000 children from Amsterdam.
They knew what they were about. That was at a time when
horses were sent round in a ring to tread corn, that the labour of
threshing it might be saved. It was a time when, near the outlying
settlements to which the children were sent, there were lions and
elephants to be met with&mdash;real live animals&mdash;recognisable by the
Noah&#8217;s ark toys of the children, whose delight at the sight of the
creatures was not always shared by their parents! How different is
all now! For thousands of miles, up and down the country, life is
as safe as in most parishes in England. The only thing to fear is
probably an enraged ostrich, and these can easily, even on an
ostrich farm where the huge birds are reared for their feathers, be
kept out of the children&#8217;s way. The little ones had a long time of
it on board ship, three months in some cases; and glad they must
have been to see the coast-line rising as they neared the Bay,
and the long flat top of the precipitous Table Mountain, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a white wreath of mist looking like snow against the delicate blue of
the sky, on its rocky summit level. They were not all kept in the
white town at the base of the beautiful mountain whose ever-changing
hues were a delight to them. The children were wisely distributed,
that they might take a liking to the place where they were
trained, and should have a feeling of home love for the part of the
country they would know while yet young. And so it should be
done by us in these later times when we have more need of the spread
of our own tongue and traditions in this great land. Careful location
is indeed necessary, but there are so many good locations, especially
along the south coast, that we need not be too timid or too dilatory.
Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, two good bays to the northward to
which railways must ultimately come&mdash;more settlements again along
the coast in temperate regions to the east, are wanted, where latitude 34
shows that no great heat can be feared&mdash;these are the &#8220;plums&#8221;
for position. And when you turn the corner of that long stretch of
coast lying along latitude 34, you must look out for higher sites
than those on the sea-beach for the young people. And of these
higher sites there are plenty. If Durban be too relaxing there is
Pietermaritzburg inland, and so of most of the ports and bays. Leaving
the coast and going inland by the railways into the &#8220;Orange&#8221; and
Transvaal, we at once meet the main difficulty of &#8220;location&#8221; in the
want of water. The Transvaal seems like a gigantic turtle-back,
and whereas in Australia you may meet with water if you dig 1500
feet or more, where there is no appearance of it on the surface, we
must wait for such revelations in the Transvaal. The territories are
fed by few good rivers, and these are apt to be either raging torrents
or dry gravel beds. But there are &#8220;fonteins&#8221; in many places, and
there is no reason why a fair sprinkling of girls&#8217; and boys&#8217; institutions
should not be comfortably located both in Transvaal and
&#8220;Orange,&#8221; where along the river of that name there is a more
certain supply of water. The Vaal is of course the largest stream
for irrigation in the north. Very little has been done to husband
the water of any of the African rivers; and the chief work to be done
in matters of material improvement is the adequate damming and
storing of the waters of all the principal streams. The winter floods,
copious and overwhelming, have been allowed to run to waste. Water
and wives must for a long time be the chief wants of South Africa.</p>

<p>Lucas gives briefly the main features of the country now under
our flag. From the south coast to the Zambesi in the neighbourhood
of the Victoria Falls is 1200 miles. The land rises steadily
from the sea as you get into the Hinterlands, and the mountain
ranges run parallel to the sea. Behind these ranges there is everywhere
an elevated plateau, and the highest plains are in the east.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
There also the rainfall is the greatest. &#8220;It is from the south or
east that men come into Southern Africa, not from the west, where
stretch the dreary deserts of Damara and Namaqua Land.&#8221; North
of the Karoo Desert the principal places are well situated for altitude.
To the west Kimberley is 4000 feet above the sea. Bloemfontein,
the capital of the Orange State, is higher by 500 feet than is
Kimberley. Mafeking has 4200 feet. Pretoria, the capital of the
Transvaal, is the same as Bloemfontein. Johannesburg, though so
near Pretoria, stands at 5600 feet. In the north, Matebele Land
has an average of 2500 feet. It is possible that deep borings may
find water in the new states where there is none at present. These
heights are sufficient to explain how it is that even far to the north
of Cape Colony European settlement may thrive, and children grow
up strong and healthy. But &#8220;location&#8221; is everything.</p>

<p>Now, what has been done to foster immigration and settlement
up to the present? Hardly anything has been done by Government.
Sir Harry Smith, who commanded in the fiercest of the
Kaffir wars, and after whose wife Ladysmith received its name,
strongly urged the policy of settling soldiers in the Colony. Between
the Fish and the Keiskamma rivers &#8220;military villages&#8221; were encouraged,
the settlers &#8220;being army pensioners liable to be called on
for the defence of the frontier.&#8221; Then again in the Queenstown
district Governor-General Cathcart proposed to settle two Swiss
Regiments, but his plan was not supported. Then Sir George Grey,
his successor, persuaded the home Government to send out 2300
of the Foreign Legion, as it was called, recruited for the Crimean
War. They were to be called on for military service, if wanted,
during a period of seven years, and they were to have pay for three
years. Each man received his land free of rent, to become his own
at the end of the seven years, if he had loyally fulfilled his engagements.
The Government of the Cape helped by a grant of money.
&#8220;At the beginning of 1857,&#8221; says Lucas in his <i>Geography of the
British Colonies</i>, &#8220;the German soldiers arrived and were settled,
some at existing towns or stations, such as East London and King
William&#8217;s Town, some on selected sites, whose villages were yet to
be built. Distributed through the eastern districts of the Colony,
and through British Kaffraria, they held the lines of communication,
as garrisons attached to, and having an interest in the soil. The
divisional district of Stutterheim still bears the name of the officer in
whose charge the soldiers came, and under whose immediate guidance
they were settled on the land. The chief drawback <i>to the
scheme was that only a few of the emigrants brought wives with them</i>.
This defect Sir George Grey sought to remedy by proposing to
import a number of German families to be located with and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
supplement the military settlers. Some were brought over, but the
total expenditure which was contemplated was too large to win the
assent of the Imperial Government, and to subsidise an exclusively
German immigration, seemed to the Secretaries of State less politic
than to provide the existing German settlers with English or Irish
wives. The Governor therefore sent on a thousand of the unmarried
soldiers to India, and those who remained behind developed
into Cape Colonists, and fell into line with the civil population.&#8221;</p>

<p>This experiment has succeeded so well that it is a wonder that
it was not repeated. Considering the enormous disproportion
in the old country between the number of men and the number of
women, it would seem a comparatively simple matter to assist female
emigration, especially when a Colony is young and able to absorb
any number sent. Nor need any Colonial Government Department
be alarmed that the worthless will be sent. There are plenty of
useful and excellent women who would be glad to go. As yet the
only woman contingents that have been sent out are the few dozen
teachers who have proceeded to the concentration camps. A party
of these hailing from Toronto and Ottawa were lately in England on
their journey to the Cape. Every one who met these ladies was
struck with the earnestness they showed and the ability they displayed
in conversing on the subject of their hopes and expectations. They
seemed a lot drafted from the best women instructresses in some New
England State. But Ontario can well afford now to be compared
with the best of the New England States in regard to her public
instruction. Her schools of all kinds are excellent. A &#8220;send off&#8221;
meeting was held in the Jerusalem Chamber at Westminster Abbey
for a party of fifty. They were addressed by Mr. Chamberlain and
Lord Peel. Now that peace has come and the camps will have
been broken up, these women will doubtless find equally useful
employment under the Education Department in the New Colonies.
The Government here have a large &#8220;reservoir&#8221; to draw upon in
the women who are employed in the telegraph and postal service
in Great Britain. Any of these persons would immediately find a
sphere of activity in the new lands. The population of these
countries is certain to increase rapidly with the opening of the old
mines and the successful exploitation of new. There are large
centres of industry where there is no want of water, where there is
a certainty of good mining success, and where communities will
grow up anxious for good schools, and well able to pay for instructors
and instructresses.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing that while at the Cape and elsewhere you
find in the hotels plenty of Swiss and German and some French
waitresses and housemaids, you find few English. Why? It must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
only from want of organisation. At Grahamstown, not far from the
bay called Algoa by the Portuguese (whose thoughts went to Goa in
India, and named Algoa and Delagoa as calling places for Goa
ships) there has been an institution for instruction lately founded.
Let me cite here the work of the South African Expansion Committee
in their own words.</p>

<blockquote><p>This Association is established to promote Protected Emigration, due regard
being had to the interests both of the Emigrants and of the countries to which
they go.</p>

<p>The Association pledges itself:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="pad1l"><p class="hangindent">(<i>a</i>) To Emigrate only such Women and Girls as are of good character
and capacity.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>b</i>) To select only such Men and Families as are suitable to the requirements
of each Colony.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>c</i>) To secure for them proper Protection on the voyage, and adequate
Reception on arrival.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>d</i>) If possible, not to lose sight of them for a year or two after their
Emigration.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(<i>e</i>) To raise a Loan Fund for necessitous cases, repayment being

<blockquote><p>It is recognised by prominent statesmen of all parties that the future of our
South African possessions depends on their colonisation&mdash;not only by the large
bodies of active and energetic men, who at the close of the war will find permanent
employment there&mdash;but also by trained and capable women. Many
situations and professions are already awaiting them, and as the country becomes
more settled, fresh openings of all sorts will arise.</p>

<p>Women of proved suitability are prepared to go, when the right time comes,
but a great barrier to all extensive development of this essential movement is
lack of funds.</p>

<p>Financial support is needed for the following purposes:&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="pad1l"><p class="hangindent">(1) The establishment, on sound business principles, of Hostels at
Cape Town<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and at the chief centres, such as Durban, Pretoria,
Kimberley, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Bulawayo, Salisbury,
&amp;c., where women and girls can be received for a few days on
arrival, and where, if they have daily engagements, they may
reside permanently. Each of these Hostels would be also an
employment Bureau for every kind of women&#8217;s work, and would
require a capable salaried Lady Superintendent to manage the
Home and the Employment Bureau, and to act as correspondent
between Employer and Employed.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(2) Provision for the proper care and guidance of women throughout
the journey from the British Isles to their final destination in
South Africa.</p>

<p class="hangindent">(3) Grants in aid of passages from the British Isles to South Africa

<blockquote><p>British men and women must alike desire for our new territories, and for
South Africa generally, the same ordered, wholesome, law-abiding traditions as
are to be found in the Old Country; and these can only be built up on a lasting
basis, by rendering life possible there as here for suitable women, whether as
teachers, nurses, secretaries, typists, telegraph or telephone clerks, sempstresses,
or household assistants.</p>

<p>We would appeal for funds not only to help those who go to earn their
daily bread, but also to enable the wives, the daughters, and sisters of settlers
to join their belongings in the new country. Many a man could make a home
for his wife or sister but for the initial cost of her passage and the difficulties
of the journey for inexperienced women. Openings in the new territories are
declined by men at the front, because they cannot bring out those dependent
upon them at home. They need that the ocean be bridged for them by kindly
forethought, by experienced and economical organisation, by suitable protection,
and by carefully adjusted financial assistance.</p>

<p>It is surely not much to ask that those to whom domestic comfort is a
matter of course, should contribute in these ways to make a home life possible
for those upon whom the future of South Africa depends.</p>

<p>The Lady Knightley, of Fawsley, in regard to the preparation for women
going to South Africa, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;In laying before the public the scheme for assisting the emigration of
women of all classes to South Africa, the Council are specially anxious to enlist
the active co-operation of ladies in all parts of the country, and with a view to
securing this assistance, they desire to draw the attention, of those who may
be disposed to help, to various methods of forwarding the scheme, in the hope
that some one or other of them may prove feasible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies could insure that those desiring to emigrate should have the
opportunity of fitting themselves for their new life by helping to provide instruction
for them in various departments of practical life.</p>

<p>&#8220;1. Cooking, Dairying, Poultry-keeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;2. Breadmaking, Laundry-work.</p>

<p>&#8220;3. Needlework, Cutting out.</p>

<p>&#8220;4. Gardening, Fruit-packing, Bee-keeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;5. Ambulance, Nursing, Health teaching.</p>

<p>&#8220;In some parts of the country this will be best accomplished by arranging
for attendance at County Council Classes for Technical Instruction,
or by putting people in the way of gaining the Scholarships which some
County Councils provide for dairying, others for nursing, &amp;c. In other districts,
where such Classes or Scholarships are not provided by the County Council,
or where the Classes are inconvenient of access, it might be arranged for
such instruction to be given in a country house. Good, old-fashioned, upper
servants, of whom there are some left, might in some cases be glad to help in
this way.</p>

<p>&#8220;An even better plan would be to arrange for girls and young women
(especially those from towns) to pass a month or two in a farmhouse, where,
under a capable farmer&#8217;s wife, much of the required teaching would come
naturally in the routine of the household. In this way a foundation might be
laid which would render the traveller of far greater use on her first arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
in South Africa than would otherwise be the case, and also more able to
acquire further knowledge should she obtain a situation on a poultry or other
farm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The improved methods of poultry-keeping inaugurated by the National
Poultry Organisation, 12 Hanover Square, should, if possible, be studied.
Ladies might supply intending travellers with copies of its valuable leaflets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some knowledge of gardening should be acquired, preferably through the
medium of the Swanley Ladies&#8217; Horticultural College. But should this prove
too long and expensive a training, a good deal might be learnt from a head
gardener if ladies would make it easy for such instruction to be given. The
best methods of packing fruit should also be acquired, and in towns, ladies who
are large customers of fruit salesmen might make interest with them for giving
instruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies who are Members of County Bee-keeping Associations might be
able to obtain for intending Emigrants some instruction from the Expert
usually attached to such Associations. Mr. Theodore Bent has pointed out
that in a country where wild bees do so well as they do in South Africa, tame
bees ought to succeed, and as butter at present is somewhat scarce, honey
might become a valuable article of food. The same remark applies to jam, and
jam-making should be included in the subjects to be taught.</p>

<p>&#8220;If possible, intending travellers should attend some ambulance, health,
and nursing lectures, which would prove a valuable possession in their future
lives. Of course, such instruction would be a good deal better than nothing,
but regular Ambulance Lectures, with an Examination to follow, would be far
better, and in many instances ladies could use their influence in the country
in getting such lectures arranged, not of course specially for Emigrants, but to
give them the opportunity of attending. They might also, in some cases, pay
the necessary fees. There are many ladies, especially among the younger
ones, who have acquired a considerable knowledge of nursing, and who might
do invaluable service by imparting to intending emigrants some acquaintance
with, at all events, such rudiments of nursing as are comprised in changing
sheets, improvised cradles, bed rests, and the hundred and one little dodges&mdash;if
they may be so termed&mdash;which make the whole difference in illness, and
which so many people are utterly ignorant of.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hoped that it may be found possible for nurses to go out on the same
ships with parties of emigrants, with a view to their giving nursing and
ambulance lectures on the voyage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies may also help by contributing to the libraries for use on board
ship and at the Hostels, which it is intended to establish for the reception of
emigrants on their arrival at Cape Town, and also in other South African
Centres.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another form of assistance would be to undertake to pay for the instruction
of emigrants in South African languages. Miss Alice Werner
(20 Dry Hill, Park Road, Tonbridge) is holding classes for the study of the
Zulu language, and also for Taal or Cape Dutch, at King&#8217;s College, Strand.
Besides these, she is prepared to give lessons in some of the languages spoken
in British Central Africa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clothes are not unfrequently needed for intending emigrants. Working
parties could be organised to provide new underclothing, which could also be
purchased from institutions and bazaars. These working parties would also
furnish a valuable opportunity for making known the scheme among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
daughters of the farmers and tradesmen, who are just the class most likely
to prove desirable denizens of the new Colonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Useful but fashionable slightly-used clothes for middle-class women might
also be collected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies with friends in South Africa may also give valuable assistance by
writing to tell them of the scheme, being careful to enclose a prospectus issued
by the Association, so that there may be no mistake as to terms, conditions,
&amp;c. Ladies in Cape Town should be asked to confer with Mrs. Bairnsfather,
Grange Avenue, Rondebosch, Cape Town, and with the Committee which has
recently been formed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It should be known to all who are kindly willing to interest themselves in
this undertaking that a Colonial Training Home has been established at Leaton,
Wrockwardine, Wellington, Salop, the object of which is to give practical
training in domestic work to ladies and girls wishing to proceed to the Colonies,
to join their families or as Mothers&#8217; Helps. The training given is of the most
thorough description, and no servants being kept, the pupils do all the work of
the house. The course lasts for three or six months, and the terms are 15s.
weekly for a single bedroom, 10s. for sharing a double one. But as only twelve
pupils can be received at a time, it will be impossible by this means only, to
train the many girls who, it is hoped, will be willing and anxious to avail
themselves of the advantages offered by this scheme; and therefore it is that
the Council confidently appeal for help on the simple but practicable lines
indicated in the foregoing pages.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>But fully as important as the emigration of adults will be the
placing of children in well-selected places in South Africa. The
object to be attained is to let children grow up in the country so
that they may regard it as their own, and that their early home
affection may be largely connected with their adopted land. The
difficulty of the selection of children is as nothing compared with the
difficulty of the selection of adults. Nor are the objections often
raised in a new community against the importation of the last, heard
against the first. A wide experience has shown that children are
eagerly sought by farmers, and are &#8220;placed out&#8221; with ease. The
remarkable success Dr. Barnardo has had in Canada, to which
country he has sent between twelve and thirteen thousand children,
has proved this. The number of failures has been only about 1
per cent. Nor is this a haphazard statement. Watch and ward
have been kept over the fortunes of the youngsters. They have
been carefully placed after due negotiation and correspondence, and
each has been reported upon after settlement. The success obtained
is best gauged by the ever-increasing number of applications for just
such boys and girls as have been previously &#8220;located.&#8221; Every
year of late years there have been three great parties sent across
the Atlantic, and the cry is ever for more to come. In spring, in
midsummer, and in &#8220;the fall,&#8221; the children have been taken out.
Entrained on arriving in Canada, the farmers have come down to
meet them at the various stations, and they have been at once taken
to their new homes, where they have almost uniformly given satisfaction
to their employers. They are growing up hearty, happy
Canadians, and many hundred letters arrive from them at Stepney
where they were trained, telling how they are &#8220;getting on.&#8221; Every
penny spent on their teaching in England has had a double return in
making room when they go for another boy or girl to be similarly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
brought up, and in providing Canada and Britain with a small
citizen &#8220;cut out of whole cloth,&#8221; as the Americans say, ready to fight
for the Empire whether in Canada, in Europe, or in Africa.</p>

<p>Now though the East End philanthropist has the greatest number
from which to draw his recruits, he does not stand alone. There is
Mr. Quarrier, near Alloa in Scotland, who is doing similar work.
In London no child who knocks at the door of the many institutions
is refused. Each is admitted, and the change in a year is marvellous.
The child has already become a good little mechanic or workman of
some kind or other. He is cleanly, disciplined, and has many an
example ahead of him and around him, to make him follow in the
good road on which he has been set. In London £5000 is now
asked for by Dr. Barnardo for the African scheme. The greatest
care is to be taken to watch over the children sent out. They are
to be carefully placed where climate and water is good, and there,
after a course of instruction in all that is most useful in South Africa,
they will be placed out as in Canada with farmers, with miners, with
mechanics, and with any who want them, if the employers can only
show that a good home is provided. But until a good home is provided
by the Colonists, they are to have a good home out there
of their own. There are opportunities of education in the local
farming pursuits that &#8220;make the mouth water,&#8221; to have children
thus placed. The pastoral work of dairying, as well as the healthy
occupations of gardening and produce-raising will all be studied and
taught on the spot. What a happy change from the crowded
thoroughfares of the east of London! And if these children succeed,
as they assuredly will, why should not the Government do a little useful
work of the same kind as that undertaken by Dr. Barnardo and by
Mr. Quarrier on its own account? Why not utilise for Africa some
of the industrial school children? They, if settled together, and sent
to English-speaking farmers, will not forget that they are English.
They will not make their farms when they get them, after their
useful school career, resound only with the expressive but illiterate
&#8220;Taal&#8221; tongue. Good Saxon (even if shorn of a few h&#8217;s) will be
heard in their homesteads in the future. They will add a good
reinforcement to those who know that freedom is not to be got by
racial separation, and the condemnation of everything British.
They will permeate the districts where they grow up to manhood
and womanhood with the British idea and practice of common
obedience to law and justice as the best security for freedom.</p>

<p>Unification has always been an ideal of South
African statesmen, and twice, at least, it has been within
measurable distance of realisation. In 1858 Sir George
Grey, who had federated the New Zealand settlements
despite the intensity of their local jealousies, promulgated
the first practical scheme of South African Federation. So
well had he ruled the Kaffir tribes on the eastern border of Cape
Colony, that the Free State, weary of warfare with the Basutos,
made overtures for a federal alliance, and the proposition of the
Volksraad was actually laid before the Cape Parliament by Sir
George Grey, before the opinion of the British Ministry in regard
to his scheme of federation on New Zealand lines and their sanction
for the course actually pursued had been received. Sir George Grey
was recalled; though on his arrival off the British coast he found
that he had been reinstated by a new Secretary of State, the delay
led to the loss of an excellent opportunity for carrying through a
measure comparable in importance with the Act which brought
about the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada.</p>

</div>

<p>For many years after the failure of Sir George Grey&#8217;s attempt,
unification was a little-regarded counsel of perfection. It is true
that the Duke of Buckingham, Secretary of State for the Colonies
in the Disraeli Ministry of 1868, admitted that it would be politic to
consider seriously any further overtures for a federal alliance from
the Boers, but the Free State was no longer in the mood to make
them, our annexation of Basutoland being resented, and the discovery
of diamonds on its western border in 1867 having created
fresh causes of irritation. When the second Disraeli Ministry came
into power, and Lord Carnarvon, who had collaborated with the
Canadian Fathers of Federation (he himself may be described as the
Godfather of the Dominion), undertook the charge of colonial affairs,
the plan proposed by Sir Henry Barkly for a confederation of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Africa, which should be the logical consequence of the grant of
autonomy to Cape Colony, was cordially received. Unfortunately
the Free State held aloof, the Cape Ministry remembered only too
well the object lessons in anti-Imperialism received from Lord
Carnarvon&#8217;s predecessors, and a <i>grain de sable</i>&mdash;the tactlessness of
Mr. Froude&mdash;caused a vast amount of friction. Even then, but for
the revival at home of the belief that political quietism and a policy
of non-interference with Colonial affairs would enable Great Britain
to retain the commercial hegemony of the world, Lord Carnarvon&#8217;s
hopes might have been realised; for he had grasped the all-important
fact that South Africa was, and must always remain, a single-minded
community, whenever the native question was discussed, and that
this unity of opinion was a stronger motive for unification than any or
all of those political or commercial considerations which had already
led to the making of the Dominion, and seemed certain, sooner or
later, to bring about the federation of the Australian Colonies.</p>

<p>In more recent years three men of commanding influence have,
each in his own way, attempted to realise the ideal of unity.
Mr. Kruger&#8217;s attempt to lay the foundation of a Dutch confederacy,
the future greatness of which would have been based (can we doubt
it?) on some form of slavery, may be dismissed as an instance of the
adage, <i>corruptio optimi pessima</i>. Mr. Cecil Rhodes worked for a
federation on the model of the United States; since the Cape was
half Dutch, the Transvaal was to be made half British, and the
settlement of Rhodesia was to insure the preponderance of Imperial
ideas in the Union of the future. He saw that the Boers must be
persuaded to co-operate, and for that reason he allied himself to
Mr. Hofmeyr, the unofficial leader of the Boer party in Cape
Colony, who also had his federal scheme. Had the two Boer
leaders agreed to work loyally together in their disloyalty, it is
conceivable that they might have brought about an act of federation
in the Boer interest, and have constitutionally demanded from Great
Britain the removal of her garrisons from South Africa, a naval
station at Simon&#8217;s Bay being conceded in order to retain the
essential measure of Imperial protection. Such, at any rate, seems
to have been Mr. Hofmeyr&#8217;s dream. But, instead of being content
to widen and deepen the influence of the Afrikander Bond until
such time as the term &#8220;suzerainty&#8221; should have been interpreted by
the heirs to Mr. Gladstone&#8217;s South African policy, Mr. Kruger
decided to make use of his hoarded armaments, and the future of
his great raid involved the failure of Mr. Hofmeyr&#8217;s long-meditated
plan of&mdash;shall we call it?&mdash;constitutional disloyalty. Nevertheless
the twofold ideal of unity, which inspired the acts both of those who
deserved and those who did not deserve to succeed, has survived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
all these vicissitudes, and was never more strong than at the present
moment. Indeed it is obvious that not only the British and Dutch
inhabitants of South Africa, but also all responsible politicians and
competent publicists in Canada and Australia, are now of opinion
that complete solutions of the three South African problems of
primary importance&mdash;the settlement of the native question, agricultural
development, and railway administration&mdash;can only be
obtained through a Federal Parliament, a body which would combine
a detailed knowledge of local conditions with the power of
seeing each problem as a whole, and devising a general solution.</p>

<p class="center gap2">II</p>

<p>The foregoing contains the gist of many conversations with
those who have a special knowledge of South Africa and South
African affairs. The opinions of Sir Albert Hime, the Prime
Minister of Natal, who may certainly claim to speak in this matter
on behalf of the South African loyalists, were expressed as follows
in an interview with the writer:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am convinced that the majority of South Africans are
anxious to see a &#8216;United South Africa,&#8217; and I believe they will see
it before long. I cannot, of course, speak for the Dutch; but I am
sure that every &#8216;Britisher&#8217; in Natal and in Rhodesia, and nine out
of every ten &#8216;Britishers&#8217; in the rest of South Africa, are in favour of
federation. The great problems of South African development
can only be completely solved by a central authority. The native
problem, for example, which is the most serious of all, is a case in
point. The difficulty of obtaining a sufficient supply of native
labour&mdash;a difficulty only to be overcome by increasing the wants of
the natives&mdash;is only one phase of this problem, but it will supply an
illustration of the necessity of considering the interests of the whole
country in dealing with such matters. As things are arranged at
present, the planters and farmers of Natal have a reasonable cause
of complaint in the fact that all their available supply of native labour
is drawn away to the Rand mines. I may add that the solidarity of
South African opinion in regard to the treatment of the natives&mdash;all
white men in South Africa are agreed, for example, that they
must never have the franchise, and that no attempt should be made
to create a navvy class in South Africa to compete with the natives
in the unskilled labour market&mdash;is a great unifying influence. The
matter of agricultural settlement is another problem which should be
considered with reference to the general interests of the whole
country. There is an impression current in certain quarters that
immigration should be diverted into the new Colonies. But once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the conception of a United South Africa is grasped, it is obvious
that a new British settler in Natal will do as much for the maintenance
of British supremacy as a new British settler in the Transvaal.
If South Africa is not to become a country of two or three
large cities in a huge, sparsely settled territory, the problem of agricultural
development should be dealt with on the broadest lines, and
in the interest of the whole country. Natal has no intention whatever
of pursuing a selfish policy in regard to the work of procuring
settlers or of obtaining a share of the Transvaal traffic.&#8221;</p>

<p>Asked to express his opinion as to when the &#8220;United South
Africa&#8221; of his hopes would come into being, Sir Albert Hime
naturally enough refused to suggest a date. &#8220;But I am strongly of
opinion that federation should take place before the new Colonies
receive self-government, or, at any rate, concurrently with that
event. That would be the safest course; for it is quite possible
that the new Colonies, after they had received autonomy, would refuse
to join. Once they have attained the privileges of self-government
as part and parcel of a &#8216;United South Africa,&#8217; I do not think
there would be any special friction; if there was, it would gradually
disappear as local jealousies grew less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Though I do not regard the question of South African Federation
as a matter of merely academic interest,&#8221; continued Sir Albert
Hime, &#8220;yet I think it would serve no useful purpose to discuss the
details of a federal scheme at the present moment. But, for my own
part, I do not regard the arguments of Mr. Cecil Rhodes in favour of
making Cape Town the federal capital as conclusive. In a speech at
Bulawayo, Mr. Cecil Rhodes summed up those arguments in a forcible
manner, and his bequest of Groote Schuur as a residence for the
Premier of the United South Africa that is to be, is an additional
argument of considerable weight. But I am inclined to think that
the fact that the Cape Peninsula is, as Mr. Rhodes said, the seaside
sanatorium of South Africa, would not compensate for the remoteness
of Cape Town from the centre of the new federation. And,
again, if Cape Town were chosen there would be a tendency to
make too much of Cape politics, and the spirit of Cape politicians
might tend to dominate the Federal Parliament. Johannesburg
would be a bad choice. Living will always be costly there, and the
influence of cosmopolitan capitalists might be exerted with bad
results. Of course we should be glad to have the capital in Natal,
but I do not expect we shall have that honour. All things considered,
Bloemfontein would perhaps be the best choice. Or we
might follow the example of the United States, Canada, and
Australia, and settle the claims of the existing capitals by creating
a new city for our federal capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Edward Barton was at first unwilling to express an opinion
on a subject &#8220;in which many with better knowledge have a deep
interest.&#8221; &#8220;But I am confident,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that before many
years have passed away we shall see a Federated South Africa,
and that no South African will wish to return to the old order of
things once that federation has come into being. I still believe
that the form chosen for the constitution of the Australian Commonwealth
was the best available, and I think that it would be better
suited to South Africa than the Canadian form. But whichever
form is chosen, the whole community will benefit by federation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We in Australia have had great difficulties to overcome, and a
certain amount of friction has necessarily arisen between the States
and the federal authority, but the history of the United States and
of the Dominion shows that such difficulties and friction cannot be
avoided, but can always be surmounted. With the exception of a
few discontented persons, I think nobody in Australia would be in
favour of a return to the old order of things, and it is already clear
that the local jealousies which hampered Australian progress are
vanishing. When I was in British Columbia nine years ago, I
tried hard to find a man who believed that the act of confederation
should be undone; but I could not discover such a person. There
may be a few &#8216;Blue Noses&#8217; in Nova Scotia who would like to see
confederation abolished, but I never met one. In either case, the
fact that Annexationists are few&mdash;too few to be counted&mdash;in
Canada, explains my failure. And once South African Federation
is an accomplished fact&mdash;and though the racial antithesis, as was
the case in Canada, renders the accomplishment more difficult than
in Australia, where a difference in opinion as to fiscal policy was
the chief obstacle&mdash;I am very sure that the vast majority of South
Africans, whether British or Dutch, will refuse to contemplate a
change to the old state of local jealousies. The sooner South
African Federation comes, the better for South Africa.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>Asked to answer the question: Should federation come before
the new Colonies receive self-government, or concurrently with that
event? Sir Edward Barton replied that in his opinion either course
would create difficulties for the future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Australian Federation,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;came out of the will
of the people. The result of a referendum proved that a majority
of the people was in favour of federation, and all the States consented
to the terms thereof. Now if the Transvaal and the Orange
River Colonies, communities that have enjoyed a form of self-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>government
in the past, had not free choice of assent or refusal,
and joined the South African Federation under compulsion (no
matter how slight a measure of compulsion), constitutional difficulties
might spring up in the hereafter. Disputes might arise between
the federal authority and these two States, and they would say,
&#8216;We were not asked for our consent, we had not complete freedom
of choice.&#8217; In any case, representation must be given to them,
and it would be awkward if two out of the five Federal States or
Provinces were trying to overthrow the federation. I do not say
this would happen, but the possibility of such an emergency should
be seriously considered. It would be safe, I think, to work and
wait for a majority in favour of federation; more especially as
there has existed and still exists, as I am informed, a strong feeling
that the interests of both peoples in South Africa would be furthered
by such a measure.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center gap2">IV</p>

<p>Neither Mr. Seddon nor Sir Wilfrid Laurier granted the
writer&#8217;s request for an expression of opinion in regard to the
possibility or probability of South African Federation. Mr.
Seddon, though he is always ready to advise the various Provinces
of the Empire in commercial matters, is averse to interfering in
other people&#8217;s politics. Moreover the word &#8220;federation&#8221; has a
discomfortable sound in the ears of his New Zealand constituents;
to a few it suggests Rossetti&#8217;s &#8220;might-have-been,&#8221; to most its echo
is a more or less decided &#8220;certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who has suffered much from the too
imaginative interviewer, both in the United States and in France,
makes it a principle not to be interviewed. But a day or two after
he had courteously declined to grant the writer&#8217;s request, he was
good enough to allude to the subject of South African Federation
in a speech at Edinburgh, from which the following excerpt is
taken: &#8220;In my humble opinion,&#8221; said the Canadian Premier, with
reference to the attempt of Mr. Rhodes to secure the unification of
South Africa, &#8220;Mr. Rhodes made one mistake. He made the
mistake of being too impatient. Had he allowed time for development,
had he allowed the Dutch population to get reconciled to the
idea of British citizenship, they would have had much sooner than
will be the case the federation of South Africa, <i>which is the only
future of that great country</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>To judge from the spirit of his utterances in Canada on the
subject of South Africa, it would appear that Sir Wilfrid Laurier&#8217;s
opinions as to the best means of working towards the end of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
African Federation do not materially differ from those of Sir
Edmund Barton. He believes that the free consent of the new
Colonies should be obtained, and that the policy pursued with
regard to Manitoba by the &#8220;Fathers of Confederation&#8221;&mdash;a policy
of which he disapproved at the time, a policy which led to a long
series of disputes between Manitoba and the Dominion Government&mdash;should
not be pursued in the case of the Transvaal and
Orange River Colonies. It will be remembered that the &#8220;Red
River Settlement&#8221; received Provincial status on condition of becoming
a member of confederation, and that the terms of membership
were accepted under compulsion, and in the hope that they
could be bettered.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="LAW_AND_LANGUAGE" id="LAW_AND_LANGUAGE"></a>LAW AND LANGUAGE</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Mr. M. J. FARRELLY, LL.D.</span></p>

<p class="center small"><i>Barrister-at-Law; Advocate of the Supreme Court of Cape Colony</i></p>

<p class="center gap2">I.&mdash;THE ROMAN DUTCH LAW AND THE LAW OF ENGLAND</p>

<p>The Roman Dutch Law&mdash;the body of legal principles and
enactments codified under the later Roman Empire by the
Emperor Justinian, as modified by legislation of the States-General
and decisions of the tribunals of Holland up to
the end of the eighteenth century&mdash;the date of the British
occupation of Cape Colony&mdash;constitutes the Common Law of all
British South Africa from the Zambesi to the sea. Indeed its
sway stretches farther north, if we include the province of Northern
Rhodesia.</p>

<p>The recent annexation to the Empire of the territories of the
two Boer Republics must necessarily have many effects not alone in
the sphere of politics, but also in that of law. But no unsettling of
the general principles of private law, regulating the rights and
duties of the citizens in private relations, can be the result. The
invariable practice of the Imperial Government&mdash;the only possible
one to prevent inextricable confusion of personal status and property
rights&mdash;has always been to enforce, as the unaltered law of
the land, any system of European Law already in operation in
territories annexed or ceded to the Empire, being already a portion
of the dominion of any State of the European Family of Nations.
In this respect the Imperial Government but follows the general
practice of other European States: a practice so uniform that it may
almost be regarded as a portion of the Law of Nations, of that
custom of the European race which for a century we are accustomed
to speak of as International Law. The committee of the Privy
Council, which, as regards the Empire outside of Europe, may be
viewed as the Imperial Court of Appeal, has therefore to adjudicate
on systems of law more numerous than these that come before any
other tribunal in the world. Not alone questions to be determined
under the Common Law of England, but suits to be decided under
that law, as modified by the legislation of the self-governing
Colonies, come under the cognisance of that unique tribunal. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the Channel Islands, whose people boast that they were never
conquered by England, are heard appeals, based on the <i>Grand
Coutumier de Normandie</i>, unknown in France since the French
Revolution. The French Law of Lower Canada, still administered
under British authority, is lifeless and unknown in the Paris
which gave it birth. Similarly the Roman Dutch Law of the
United Provinces, now enforced in the former over-sea possessions
of Holland, has long ago been swept away in Low Countries,
surviving as the law of the land only in the British possessions,
in South America, in Ceylon, and in South Africa. With one
result, arresting the attention of the historical student, that in our
own day British tribunals accept, as of the highest authority&mdash;in
many matters most vitally affecting the status and property of British
citizens from the Lion&#8217;s Head to the Line, the recorded opinions of
a Pretorian prefect of the Roman Empire in York&mdash;the brightest of
the five stars of the <i>Loi des Citations</i>.</p>

<p>The tribunals of the Empire constitute a museum of former systems
of law, flourishing far from their parent springs. But every
change is not necessarily progress. The marked liking of British
colonists, born in the United Kingdom, for the Roman Law under
whose sway they have passed is a very instructive phenomenon.
Wisdom, they seem to think, did not die with the fashioners of that
&#8220;codeless myriad of precedents, that wilderness of single instances&#8221;
which, evolved according to imperturbable theory from the bosom
of the English judiciary, is known as the Law of England.</p>

<p>This preference is the more impressive, seeing that on many
vital matters, not mere abstractions of jurisprudence, the Roman
Dutch Law differs from the English systemless system.</p>

<p>The personal status of all residents in the new British Colonies
falls under rules quite different from the English rules as to capacity
to enter into and to perform contracts, as to property rights, and as
to family relations. Results of some importance may chiefly be
expected from the fact that, since the annexation and the transformation
of the Republics into British Colonies, the presumption in
law that British immigrants intend to adopt a new domicile, and subject
themselves and their property to a new legal system, must
necessarily be stronger than when residence was being taken up in
the territory, then foreign, of two Boer Republics. In the future,
not alone, as hitherto, contracts of service and contracts as regards
property, but the relationship, personal and as affecting property,
of marriage and succession, will fall under the jurisdiction of a High
Court administering primarily the Law of Rome. The Court will
apply the Law of England to those latter conditions only in cases in
which they consider that, in accordance with the principles of Private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
International Law, the English system is applicable&mdash;the presumption
now being that, as a general rule, it is not applicable.</p>

<span class="small">Prime Minister of Cape Colony.</span>
</div>

<p>As regards the capacity of adults to enter into and be bound by
contract, the most striking difference between the English and
Roman Dutch systems is the survival, under the latter, of a modified
form of the Roman Interdiction of the Prodigal. Under certain
circumstances, on application of friends or relatives, such an order
can issue. Again, contracts of service made out of South Africa are
not binding unless entered into again before a public official in
South Africa.</p>

<p>In respect to the tenure of property, more especially of property
in land, the differences which exist are all in favour of Roman Dutch
Law. An admirable system of registering titles to land, whether of
ownership or mortgage, exists in South Africa, as on the Continent
of Europe, where that most valuable legacy from the Roman Empire
has remained unchanged in principle to our day. No tedious scrutiny
of documents attesting title to land is necessary, as it is in England.
The official register is sufficient proof of ownership. Transfer is rapid
and inexpensive. Again, unavoidable calamity, amounting to a condition
of impossibility of beneficial occupation, excuses from the
necessity of payment of rent of land. Such excuse is not known to
the Law of England.</p>

<p>Unlike the Law of England, but like the Law of Scotland, desertion
by either party to a marriage furnishes ground for absolute
divorce, with right of re-marriage. The system, flowing directly
from the Roman Law, both in Scotland and South Africa, is
understood to work satisfactorily, comparatively few divorces being
sought for.</p>

<p class="center gap2">II.&mdash;THE MODERN LAW OF SOUTH AFRICA</p>

<p>Leaving the general principles of the law affecting personal
status, family relations, and property rights, the difference between
the Law of England and that of South Africa practically disappears
as regards Europeans in social relations. In the whole field of
Commercial Law, and in that of the Law of Crimes and Punishments,
the Law of England has practically been adopted in all the States
and Colonies. The origin of this state of the law is, of course, to be
found in the fact that the Roman Law conceptions were out of
harmony with modern commercial conditions and the competition of
the World Market; and also that their code of Crimes and Punishments
has become inappropriate to the later forms of European
civilisation.</p>

<p>Several features of South African legislation require more special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
notice. The Transvaal Law may be taken as typical of that of the
other States, and political and economical conditions make the law
of the late Republics of most importance and interest to the British
public. The most salient topics are those dealt with by the Law of
Mines, the law as to the natives, and the Law of Universal Military
Service.</p>

<p>The law as to minerals, including not alone gold and silver, but
all precious metals and precious stones, is based on State ownership.
It is expressly declared: &#8220;The right of mining for and disposal of
all precious stones and precious metals belongs to the State.&#8221;</p>

<p>The State, however, does not undertake the work of mining,
but grants, under certain conditions, that privilege to various classes
in the community. The Government is authorised by law to
proclaim a specified area to be public &#8220;diggings.&#8221; Thereupon,
certain rights are reserved to the owner of the farm wherein the
area is situated. These rights are in effect to select certain portions
of the proclaimed area as mining &#8220;claims&#8221; belonging to the owner,
and to mark off these portions. The remainder of the area is
then open to appropriation by the public, the first comer having
the first right. Shortly before the war of 1899, in consequence
of scenes of disorder attending the marking off of these &#8220;claims&#8221;
by the general public, steps were taken to introduce a system of
assigning the mining areas by lot among the residents in each
district.</p>

<p>The taxation of the mineral grounds was, and is, based on a
dual system. The one is taxation, by means of levying a monthly
due, called a &#8220;claim licence,&#8221; in the mere possession of a mining
area, called a &#8220;claim,&#8221; whether or not the area is being developed.
The other principle, superadded to the first, was that of taxing
the profits of each mine. Before the war this latter tax amounted
to five per cent.</p>

<p>In relation to gold mining, in one very important respect
the Law of the Transvaal, like that of Cape Colony, is in striking
opposition to the rules of civilised law all over the world. The
famous I. D. B. (Illicit Diamond Buying) enactments passed to
protect diamond mining in Kimberley have a parallel in the I. G. B.
(Illicit Gold Buying) provisions of the Transvaal Law. It is incumbent
on the possessor of rough diamonds to prove his innocence.
Similarly, under the Gold Law of the Transvaal, &#8220;Any one who
is found in possession of amalgam or unwrought gold, or uncut
precious stones, and can give no proof that he obtained possession
of the same in a lawful manner,&#8221; is punishable with fine and
imprisonment. For a third offence, the amount of fine and imprisonment
with hard labour is at the discretion of the Court, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
forfeiture of the unwrought gold, or uncut precious stones, follows
conviction.</p>

<p>It is true that in England, for instance, a similar exception is
in force with reference to the possession of explosives, a measure
intended to prevent Anarchist outrages. But the difference is
very great between the two classes of cases. The manufacture and
sale of explosives is not the staple industry of England, as the
production of gold and diamonds is in South Africa. The chief
occupation of the industrial population of England is not affected;
the provision remains only one of some inconsiderable exceptions
to the general rule, that every one is presumed innocent until he is
proved guilty.</p>

<p>The law relating to natives, under which head are included
all the coloured races, is equally strange to those familiar only
with the Law of England. The so-called Pass Law provides that
every native in districts or towns inhabited by Europeans&mdash;everywhere,
in fact, except in the native villages&mdash;must be in possession
of an official passport, showing he is registered in an official State
registry. Other regulations limit the action of the native&mdash;the
Curfew regulations, compelling Kaffirs in town districts to remain
indoors after sunset. Municipal rules, prohibiting Kaffirs from
walking on the footpath of the street, and special rules of the
Criminal Law affect them. The lash is presented as the penalty
for various offences. The death penalty is inflicted for Kaffir
outrages on women of the European race. By the imposition of
a Hut Tax, payable annually, the Kaffir is induced to labour; an
occupation which, if left to himself, he prefers to leave to women.</p>

<p>The Law of Universal Military Service, applying to all Europeans
who are burghers&mdash;a law of all the States of South Africa&mdash;furnishes
another point of divergence from the Law of England. In
the Transvaal all burghers over the age of sixteen and up to the
age of sixty are under the military command of the elected Field
Cornet of the district. In time of war the age begins at fourteen
and has no fixed limit for ending. This, be it noted, is not a case
of conscription; it is a levy <i>en masse</i>, taken as a normal condition
of life. Burghers on commando are exempt from civil process, and
are exempt from the obligation of paying claim licenses for the
period they are on commando.</p>

<p class="center gap2">III.&mdash;RECENT BRITISH MODIFICATIONS</p>

<p>It is, of course, in the present stage of our information impossible
to state fully the various modifications which have been introduced
in the new Colonies since the British annexation two years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Some changes worth noticing have, however, been published.</p>

<p>In Private Law, the chief change of which we have information
appears to have been the abolition of the Orphan Chamber of
Roman Dutch Law&mdash;a State department concerned with the
administration of infants&#8217; estates. The change, however, seems
only to have been one of administration and title, the duties of
the abolished Chamber being transferred to the Attorney-General&#8217;s
Department.</p>

<p>As regards the Gold Law, an enactment by the late Republic of
a war-tax on the gold output of from forty to fifty per cent. has been
abolished. The British tax on the mines has been fixed by proclamation
at ten per cent. on the profits of each mine. The system
of claim licenses&mdash;taxation on the possession of mining areas&mdash;is
continued.</p>

<p>Minor modifications of the details of the Native Pass Law have
also been announced, including the restriction of the number of
cases, and of the power of magistrates to sentence Kaffirs to the
punishment of the lash.</p>

<p>The Law of Military Service appears to remain up to the present
unmodified. Indeed, a recent decision in the newly established
British High Court of the Transvaal has very rigidly construed
a provision of the Gold Law, protecting burghers on commando
from liability to pay license dues. The Court refuses to allow to
Uitlanders the same privilege as that allowed to burghers in arms.
The Uitlander, according to that decision, is liable to pay these arrears
accruing during the war to the present British administration.</p>

<p class="center gap2">IV.&mdash;PRINCIPLES OF IMPERIAL POLICY&mdash;OBSTACLES IN THE
WAY OF THEIR BEING CARRIED OUT</p>

<p>Before considering specific suggestions as to actual legislation
required in the new Colonies, it is necessary to set clearly before us
what are the objects to be aimed at by Imperial statesmen. Most of
the errors of the past century of Imperial rule in South Africa are
traceable to the fact that no steady and consistent policy has been
adopted for any definite period. With every change of government
in the United Kingdom the British policy in South Africa altered.
As I have written elsewhere, it swung with bewildering inconsistency,
according to whether an Imperialist or a Little Englander
Government was in power, from an expansionist to a &#8220;retrenchment&#8221;
policy. Alternately negrophilist and anti-Kaffir, alternately
conciliatory to the Dutch and aggressively British. &#8220;Nothing
more fixed than the certainty of Imperial change, unless, indeed, it
were the cruelty of Imperial ingratitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall take it, then, that consistency is the least we may expect
as the result of the late war. The maintenance of the integrity of
the world-wide Empire, plainly bound up with the retention of
South Africa, involving the possession of the only secure sea-route
to Australia and India; the upholding of the banner of
European justice and humanity in Africa, the British portion of the
mission of the European race the world over&mdash;to this end, the fusion
of all strains of the European people in a new nationality to form a
constituent part of the Empire&mdash;these I take to be the objects of
Imperial statesmen in the United Kingdom and the Colonies, and
of all loyal citizens of the Empire.</p>

<p>Now, these principles being fixed, we have next to consider what
are the dangers threatening the successful carrying out of a policy
based on these principles.</p>

<p>The first, and most formidable, danger is that arising from the
existence in all the Colonies of South Africa of a Separatist party
among the Boer section of the population, usually described as the
Young Afrikander party. Its origin is due to many historic causes;
among which not the least has been the unwise and vacillating
policy of the Imperial Government. That party is by no means
extinct as a result of the late war. No matter what professions are
made in the Land of Diplomatists, it has to be reckoned with for our
time and generation. It relies for the ultimate success of its policy
of substituting a Boer-ruled independent State for British citizenship
of the Empire on many causes. In the first place, the stubborn
tenacity of the Boer people, and their slowness to abandon any
long-held purpose. Again, on their military skill, their religious
fanaticism, their conviction that they are the Lord&#8217;s elect, and that His
sword will smite not in vain. Yet again, and most of all, on the
enormous birth-rate among the Boers&mdash;families of twelve sons
being not uncommon. Boer ignorance of the power and purpose of
the Empire&mdash;of the real character of that federation of freemen&mdash;figures
also in their calculations; and as well the barrier against fusion
of the European strains kept up by the use of that <i>patois</i> of the
Hollander tongue, the South African <i>Taal</i>. Lastly, their main
reliance is on future inefficiency of the Imperial administration&mdash;marred
by negrophilist British missionaries and English society
nepotism and favouritism&mdash;on the see-saw of British party politics,
and on the prospects of the Empire becoming involved in war with
some great European Power.</p>

<p>The next danger is that arising from the presence on the goldfields
of the Transvaal of vast agglomerations of cosmopolitan finance
owning most of the mineral wealth of the State. On many points,
the interest of these groups is not the same as those of the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Government and those of the rank and file of the British settlers.
Taxation of the mines for Imperial purposes, such as those of State-aided
British immigration and State-constructed irrigation works,
cannot be in the interest of the mining groups. The lowering of
the wages of the white miners is clearly in their interest; while
opposed to the prospects of welfare of British miners and British
merchants in the towns, to those of the professional classes, and,
above all, to the interests of British agricultural settlers, whose
occupation cannot be profitable for many years to come unless their
market is at their door. Mining profits remitted to Berlin and
Paris, instead of going to the pockets of resident British miners,
cannot benefit the British agricultural settler. Again, the truck
system, by which employers supply goods to their workers (a system
illegal in England), while it may increase the profits of the mining
groups, would be destruction of the trade of the British dwellers in
the towns. This aspect of the question is rendered more serious by
the fact that practically all the press of South Africa is owned or
controlled by the financiers of the mining groups.</p>

<p>Lastly, a danger which has existed for generations is that arising
from the existence of a body of sentiment in the United Kingdom
which, for want of a better word, is called negrophilism. This
sentiment is usually voiced by British missionaries, and advocates an
impossible black man and brother theory. Its effect on British
legislation and administration in South Africa caused the first dissension
of moment between Boers and British at the time of the
abolition of negro slavery in 1836. The whole theory is felt by all
Europeans of South African experience to be based on a flat contradiction
of the facts of life and the teaching of the 250 years of
European contact with the South African native&mdash;Bushman,
Hottentot, or Kaffir. Allied with this is the colour-blindness of
some Anglo-Indians, who favour the disastrous measure of flooding
South Africa with Asiatics from India.</p>

<p class="center gap2">V.&mdash;LINES OF LEGISLATION TO CARRY OUT THE
IMPERIAL POLICY</p>

<p>Having defined the Imperial policy in South Africa to be the
maintenance of the integrity of that federation of freemen which is
the British Empire, the upholding of the banner of European justice
and humanity in the Dark Continent, and for the promotion of these
ends the fusion of all strains of the European race in one community,
let us now consider the general lines of State action requisite
to carry out that policy.</p>

<p>All parties loyal to the Empire are agreed that the first requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
from the standpoint of the Imperial welfare is the promotion of the
immigration of British agriculturists to South Africa. The enormous
birth-rate of the Boer people will prevent any prospect of fusion
between British and Boers&mdash;anything, in fact, but the swamping of
the British element&mdash;unless this immigration be organised by the
State. The life of the gold and diamond mines cannot last longer&mdash;so
those qualified to speak are agreed&mdash;than a few generations.
With the exhaustion of the mines, the British population, if confined
to the towns, would inevitably disappear. Again, the Boers being
essentially country folk, could never have that close association with
the British necessary for the coalition of a united people, unless the
British are settled as agriculturists. A most encouraging precedent
of the success of State-organised immigration of British settlers on
the land is to be found in the State-aided immigration of 1820 into
the Eastern Province of Cape Colony.</p>

<p>Exactly as in Egypt and in India, agriculture, to be prosperous
and to extend over large areas, is impossible in South Africa
unless with the aid of State-constructed irrigation works. The
water supply, both from rainfall and underground natural reservoirs,
is ample; but engineering skill is required to enable these sources
to be utilised all the year round. The recently published report of
Mr. W. Willcocks shows what favourable prospects exist for the
carrying out of a general system of State irrigation works.</p>

<p>One word of warning is necessary. The general impression, so
sedulously created for many years past, of the unsuitability of South
Africa as a sphere for British immigration, is, as Mr. Rudyard
Kipling has pointed out, only a part of a political propaganda,
intended to exclude British influence. It may be entirely
ignored.</p>

<p>The next requisite of State action is the promotion, by legislation
and administration, of the development of the present and future
goldfields, and other mineral fields, in such manner as may tend to
further the general ends of the Imperial policy as already described.
The taxation of the mines should be so adjusted as to favour British
immigration and the creation of a prosperous and loyal British
community. The development of new fields should be encouraged;
adequate sums should be raised for public objects; the minerals,
expressly declared to be property of the State, should be primarily
regarded as a fund for State purposes, not one for the creation of
millionaires or the undue enriching of shareholders in Hamburg or
Paris or Vienna. The welfare of the mass of British residents in
the towns engaged in trade should be considered in legislation
affecting the gold mines.</p>

<p>In view of the presence of an overwhelming majority of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
subject Kaffir race, all Europeans should be trained to arms, on the
model of the laws already in existence in the two new Colonies.
From an Imperial, as distinguished from a European standpoint,
this measure is equally necessary. The Boers are born soldiers: a
nation in arms. No reliance on a professional army or professional
police can afford any assurance of stability for the Imperial rule.
The Boers would regard such a régime as merely one of transitory
military domination.</p>

<p>An efficient system of education, from primary school to
university, should be organised and carried out. In the new
Colonies great progress has already been made in this direction,
and a recently published address by Mr. W. Sargent, the Director
of Education, shows that the principles to be kept in mind are
clearly apprehended.</p>

<p>A sane and consistent policy with regard to the status of the
Kaffir and other non-European people should be adopted and
adhered to. The Boer position, that the Kaffir is not in justice
entitled to equality, social or political, with Europeans, should be
upheld, as that plainly sanctioned by European experience of two
centuries and a half.</p>

<p>Efficiency should be insisted on as the test for appointment in
the public service. Salaries on an adequate scale should be given,
bearing in mind the standard of payment usually obtaining in
gold-bearing districts. The obstacles in the way of making
efficiency the test of appointment should be clearly understood,
and as far as possible guarded against; the persistence of Young
Afrikander Separatist ideals, and the readiness of the propagandists
to accept office under the Imperial Government; the
danger of undue weight being given to the influence of the great
capitalists; the equal danger of the intrigue, favouritism, and
nepotism of London society&mdash;of which so much was heard at the
late Committee of Inquiry into the training of army officers&mdash;being
brought to bear on appointments to office in the new Colonies.</p>

<p>The language question&mdash;that of the degree of recognition
necessary or expedient of the Dutch language in the courts and
public offices&mdash;is so important that it is better to consider it
separately.</p>

<p class="center gap2">VI.&mdash;THE LANGUAGE QUESTION</p>

<p>The question of the degree of recognition of the Dutch language
in the new Colonies to be accorded by the new administration is one
of the most difficult, and at the same time one of the most urgent
and altogether inevitable, presented by the altered situation, the
result of the late war. It is one of the cases where not to decide is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to decide. Let us endeavour to understand the conditions of the
problem, bearing steadily in mind the objects to be aimed at by the
Imperial policy.</p>

<p>No responsible statesman in the United Kingdom or in the
Colonies can desire to take any step other than conciliatory to Boer
sentiment, provided the main object of creating a united and
prosperous European community is obtained. Anything like a
persecution of the Boer tongue or traditions would not only be
unjust, but most unwise. At the same time, Imperial statesmen
must remember that British-descended citizens of the Empire in
South Africa hold that their sentiment and their opinion is not to
be taken as a matter to be ignored. Now, Imperialist sentiment in
South Africa is united as to the desirability of having only one
official language, and of doing away with the dual language system
introduced in Cape Colony twenty years ago.</p>

<p>Limiting any action of the Imperial Government, must necessarily
be the conditions as to the recognition of Dutch agreed upon with
the Boer generals as one of the terms of peace. These conditions
were that the Dutch language is to be taught in the schools, in cases
where the parents of the children desire it; and in the courts of law in
cases where, in the opinion of the court, the ends of justice will be
furthered by its use. The wish of the parents and the discretion
of the law-courts are, therefore, to be arbiters. The peace terms, in
this matter, seem wholly reasonable; but the main question of a dual
language remains unaffected.</p>

<p>Let us first deal with the cause of much misapprehension in the
United Kingdom in this matter. Here I will quote from an article
of mine published some time before the peace agreement:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no question here of the suppression of the language
of a people. The language of the Boer people of South Africa is
a patois called the Taal, based on the seventeenth-century Hollander
Dutch, with a mixture of many strange words, Kaffir and English,
and with the omission of most grammatical inflexions. In that
happy tongue you are permitted to say: &#8216;I is.&#8217; It is needless to
say there is no literature in this patois, as there is in the Hollander
Dutch of this century. Now, it is only to Hollander Dutch that it
is proposed to accord equal audience as an official language. The
official recognition of Hollander Dutch dates from 1882 in the Cape
Colony, and is a result of the political propaganda of the Afrikander
Bond. It was openly announced and hailed as the &#8216;thin end of the
wedge&#8217; to prevent the fusion of the Boer and British strains of the
European people, and to drive the British into the sea. It is almost
as grotesque a misrepresentation to call this claim for the official recognition
of Hollander Dutch a popular demand, as if, in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
modern Italy, we were told that the peasants of Umbria or the Marches
were hungering and thirsting for the recognition of Augustan Latin
as entitled to equal audience with Italian in the courts and public
offices of Italy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The veld Boer does not understand Hollander Dutch. He
only hears the Hollander tongue, or, rather, the seventeenth-century
predecessor of it, in the text from the seventeenth-century Dutch
Bible read out in the churches on Sundays by the predikant, or in
the hymns, once chanted by his forefathers of the Lowlands, who
worsted Alva, persecutor of the Saints of the Lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will clear the air greatly if people at home will realise what
is the force behind this Hollander Dutch language movement. It is
the Young Afrikander party.</p>

<p>&#8220;For sixty years English was the sole official language in South
Africa. The experiment of two official languages is one of only twenty
years&#8217; duration, and has not been crowned with any conspicuous
success, unless racial cleavage, political and social, be counted as such.</p>

<p>&#8220;No other course can so speedily promote the fusion of all
Europeans. Judging by the trend of events, the future among the
European people belongs to one or two of the great languages. It
is significant that, at the present moment of time, with a knowledge
of English and French, one can travel the world. The fusion of
European strains, so happily accomplished in the United States of
America, is admittedly due to the determined enforcement of a single
language as the sole official language of the Republic. Immigrants
of all European nationalities learn to speak and write English&mdash;their
children of the next generation become Americans. As a
London Consul-General of the United States pointed out to me, the
reunion of the European race, as a political measure on a vast scale,
has been first accomplished in the American Commonwealth. Never
since the pre-historic time of the root-origins of our language, never
since the corporate unity of the Roman Empire, has there been so
vast a breaking down of barriers between Europeans.</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter is one of political expediency, not of æsthetics.
The unity of the European people is a greater historic fact and
present reality than any of those brief heritages of common life for
a few short centuries of one or other sections of the race, giving rise
to the national tongues. Personally, one may sympathise with the
scholar&#8217;s preference for a survival of Latin as the language of
Europe, as it was during the Roman Empire, as it was during the
Middle Ages, and as it would have remained but for the outburst
of Nationalist particularism during the sixteenth century. One may
lament, with a loyal European like Talleyrand, what that outburst
has cost Europe; led by the ambition of the House of Capet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
France, of the Tudor in England, and the princes of North Germany,
plunderers of the Teutonic knights. No doubt it is true that
thousands of millions of pounds and millions of lives have been
wasted by that particularism&mdash;strange step-child of the unifying
Renaissance. From the æsthetic side, it is vain to argue whether
Keltic be a purer tongue, more passionately expressive, Spanish
more majestic, or Italian liquid music. The sieve of the gods seems
hitherto to let through, for the world of the European race, only two
of the great tongues&mdash;French and English.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a word, for all æsthetic purposes, let the various harmonies
of all the tongues of the European race continue to enrich the choir,
enshrining memories of the past. But for the political field of
action the trumpet of command and order should sound a note
clear from its being single.</p>

<p>Any incidental inconvenience, such as must arise to the first
generation of immigrants to the American Commonwealth, must only
be treated as transitory, and, as far as possible, provided against.
Very few Europeans who do not know English have business in the
law-courts or public offices. In the years preceding the late war,
only five out of every hundred cases in the Transvaal law-courts
were between people not conversant with English. For this small
minority, in all the public offices and the courts, competent interpreters
can be provided.</p>

<p class="center gap2">VII.&mdash;LEGISLATIVE MEASURES</p>

<p>It may be well that I should add some suggestions as to the
measures which I at present hold should be taken to put into force
the general lines of legislation, already sketched out as suitable
for the carrying out of the Imperial policy as already defined. But
it should be understood that these suggestions are only intended
as furnishing material for discussion. In the absence of fuller
information as to future needs and emergencies, it would be unwise
to finally advocate concrete measures. What is, in my mind, of
importance is not any specific measure, but the principles of
Imperial policy on which I have insisted. If it can be shown to
me, in the future discussions on these matters, in which I hope to
take part on my return to South Africa, that other measures are
better suited to carry out the consistent policy I have defined, I
shall be prepared to advocate such other measures.</p>

<p>In the first place, I think that in view of the wide divergence
of opinion and interest, among the British residents quite as much
as among the Boers, a consultative body, nominated by the High
Commissioner, should be appointed to advise on any projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
legislation. For some time, while the form of Crown Colony
Government is continued, advice from such a body will be specially
needful. Apart from the maintenance of law and order, the interests
of the great mining groups, representation of shareholders resident
in Europe is by no means necessarily the same as those of the rest
of the British residents, or indeed those of the Imperial Government.
Among such matters of divergence of interest may be enumerated
the scale and method of taxation on the mines, no matter for what
Imperial purpose&mdash;British immigration, State irrigation works, or
university and general education. The maintenance of the present
very high rate of wages of the European miners is another subject.
British residents in the towns, shopkeepers, importers, professional
men and their employees, are concerned in the maintenance of a
high rate of wages for the miners, as the money is spent in the
country, not in Paris or Berlin. Again, the introduction of the
truck system, the supply of goods by the miners to their employees,
European or Kaffir, while it would increase the profits of mining
shareholders in Europe, would destroy the means of existence of the
bulk of the British residents in the towns.</p>

<p>Amongst the Boers, there is almost as great divergence of
interest between the wealthy farmers, desirous of keeping together
their vast cattle ranches of 6000 acres, and the class of Bijwoners
(tenants at will on an over-lord&#8217;s land), whose interest would be
favoured by the dividing up of cattle ranches, and the encouragement
of small farmers who would be agriculturists.</p>

<p>For this reason, a consultation body should be thoroughly representative
of all classes.</p>

<p>Direct legislation favouring British immigration of agriculturists
is plainly necessary, and as well the creation of State irrigation
works. Such steps, it is reassuring to know, have already been
taken. Personally, I am in favour of village ownership of agricultural
lands being instituted, a system with which the Boers are
already familiar, in connection with the cultivation of the lands
owned by the towns.</p>

<p>To promote the prosperity of British residents in the towns, and
as well to secure a market for agricultural produce, the truck system
should be prohibited by law; and the compound system, under
which the Kaffir workmen in mines are not only supplied with
goods but confined to barracks called &#8220;compounds,&#8221; should also be
prohibited. Neither system has hitherto been in force in the new
Colonies.</p>

<p>As regards the Gold Law, the new British administration has
established a tax of ten per cent. on the net profits of each mine,
and has retained the previous system as well, of taxing the pos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>session
of mining areas. It will require some time to see how the
present method of levy affects the growth of the British population.
Personally, I have not been convinced by the arguments in favour
of the &#8220;claim license&#8221; system: it is held by its opponents that it
tends to throw all the mining areas into the possession of the great
mining groups, the areas being forfeited to the State in times of
depression by poorer men who are unable to continue to pay.
Suggestions deserving consideration have been made as to the
advisability of the State developing gold areas already in the possession
of the State.</p>

<p>As regards the arrears of claim licenses accruing during the war
against the expelled British inhabitants, I have strongly advocated
in the London press their entire remission. The Boer burgher on
commando is held to be exempted; it is difficult to see why the
expelled British should not also be exempted.</p>

<p>Another measure which I have supported is that of the arming
of all British civilians, for reasons already enumerated. An essential
to the measure being successful, being loyally supported, is that, on
the Boer model, the officers of the corps should be elected by their
men. British colonists, with their traditions of liberty and independence,
will never submit to being compulsorily placed on military
service and subjected to the orders of officers whom they have not
chosen.</p>

<p>No measure of greater political moment can be taken than the
thorough organising of a system of education, from the university
to the school. I am one of those who support the making of the
Gold Reef city a great university centre.</p>

<p>As regards the Native Law, I advocate as little as possible
alteration in the laws already in force. The Boer theory of the
position of the Kaffir&mdash;as not an equal, but entitled to justice,
under tutelage to a government directed by European ideals&mdash;is the
sound one.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Asiatic immigration in any form, whether of British Indians
from India, or Chinese from Hong-Kong or elsewhere, would be a
measure fraught with disaster to the future of European civilisation.
With the exception of some employers of labour in Rhodesia and
Natal, South African opinion&mdash;British, Boer, even Kaffir&mdash;is
opposed to Asiatic immigration. Even the employers referred to
only desire to encourage the importation of Asiatics as manual
labourers, not as owners of the land or traders in the towns.</p>

<p class="center large"><b>ITS ORIGIN, ITS GROWTH, ITS AIMS</b></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By the HON. A. WILMOT</span></p>

<p class="center small"><i>Member of the Legislative Council, Cape Colony; Author of &#8220;History of Our Own Times
in South Africa,&#8221; &amp;c., &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>One of the greatest statesmen whose experience and
ability have assisted the Imperial Government declares
that it was only after two years&#8217; residence that he
understood the political problems affecting South
Africa. Hundreds rush in where Milners fear to
tread, and the little knowledge which induces superficial views and
rash judgment on a merely <i>primâ facie</i> case are now at present, as
they have been in the past, among the causes which impede the
progress of a vast country which we hope will yet become a great
federated dominion under the British crown.</p>

<p>It is because of the vital importance of going to the root of
the political questions affecting South Africa that this paper is
written.</p>

<p>The origin of the Africander party is traceable principally to
discontent with British rule. The Cape Colony, as our readers
know, was obtained by conquest in 1806, and by purchase from
the Netherlands for six million pounds sterling in the year 1814.
Mr. Paul M. Botha, Member of the Orange Free State Volksraad
for Kroonstadt, states the case from the Dutchman&#8217;s point of view,
and tells us that as England said that South Africa was her country
she ought to have governed it, instead of which she shirked
responsibilities and was guilty of the most glaring inconsistencies.
One day England blew hot and the next cold. &#8220;One moment she
insisted on swallowing us, and the next moment she insisted on
disgorging us.&#8221; For example, the Orange Free State was declared
British territory because a governor said, &#8220;You can never escape
British jurisdiction.&#8221; Then we were abandoned because the next
governor said, &#8220;The country was a howling wilderness.&#8221; The
Transvaal was annexed, and Sir Garnet Wolseley declared: &#8220;The
rivers will sooner run back in their courses than that England will
give back the Transvaal.&#8221; Shortly after that the Transvaal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
retroceded, after Majuba, because the British Ministry said, &#8220;We
have been unjust in annexing this country.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The slavery question, Mr. Botha tells us, was handled with
astounding negligence and ignorance of the circumstances of the
people. Although England was perfectly right in emancipating the
slaves, yet the way it was done irritated, annoyed, and disgusted the
people, and sowed seeds of distrust which have never been eradicated.
England failed to carry out effectively her promises of
compensation.</p>

<p>On the minor grievances, such as Slagter&#8217;s Nek and other so-called
injustices of England, Mr. Botha lays no stress. &#8220;It was a
rough period, and rough measures were used by all Governments.&#8221;
He significantly adds that what he has heard of the cruelty of the
Dutch East India Company&#8217;s officials makes him think that anyhow
British rule was heaven to that of the Dutch. Whatever a well-educated
man like Mr. Botha may say, we know that the rank and
file of the Dutch throughout South Africa are taught to &#8220;Remember
Slagter&#8217;s Nek.&#8221; Nothing can be more unjust than to blame the
British power for executing rebels, caught red-handed and sentenced
to death in perfect accord with both evidence and law by a competent
Court, whose members were themselves of Dutch extraction.
Nevertheless this is one of the heavy popular grievances.</p>

<p>Mr. Botha says that England&#8217;s weak and spasmodic policy in
South Africa has made the Boer what he is to-day&mdash;distrustful and
contemptuous of British statesmen. By further receding into the
interior, and having to fight wild beasts and hordes of Kaffirs, the
Boer became blown out with vanity at his own prowess, and more
and more ignorant. Through this ignorance it is easier to mislead
than to lead him. A man who plays upon his vanity and prejudices
against England quickly obtains influence. A loud talker and
blusterer gets a better hearing than a quiet reasoner. &#8220;I ascribe
this to want of education and complete isolation on the veldt.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a marked illustration in support of Mr. Botha&#8217;s view which
has come under the present writer&#8217;s observation, let us tell what
occurred shortly before the war to a nephew of the Speaker of the
House of Assembly who had to travel through the Transvaal to
look after some landed property. This gentleman, who spoke the
Taal perfectly, met at one place about two dozen Dutchmen who
were, like the Laird of Cockpen, &#8220;greatly ta&#8217;en up with the &#8217;fairs of
the State.&#8221; The first question, &#8220;Can we beat the British?&#8221; was
answered by a unanimous &#8220;Yes, we have done so before, and
can, of course, easily do so again.&#8221; Second. &#8220;Tell me, Carls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
could we beat England and France united?&#8221; &#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said
every one, &#8220;there can be no doubt about it.&#8221; But now interposed
a new speaker. &#8220;How if we had to fight England, France, and
Germany?&#8221; The reply was unanimous. &#8220;We can beat them
all three.&#8221; No wonder that the people of the Lord, as they
believed themselves to be, took the bit between their teeth at
the time of the ultimatum. Not even Paul Kruger could then
have stopped the war, for they felt perfectly assured of victory.</p>

<p>With a religion which has not unfitly been described as a superstition
based upon the Old Testament, there is profound ignorance
accompanied by prejudice of the most deep-rooted character. Mr.
Botha tells us that unfortunately the ministers of the Dutch Reformed
Church, &#8220;greedy for the fat lamb, the fowl, and the purse,&#8221;
foster this ignorance. One Predikant had actually the audacity to
tell his congregation that God <i>must</i> help His chosen people, otherwise
He would lose His influence.</p>

<p>Mr. Botha defends his own people against charges of treachery,
and gives it as his fixed opinion that a just and firm Government
with uniformity of treatment will not only control and satisfy the
Boers, but eradicate in time that feeling of distrust and fear
which was engendered in their minds by the halting and unequal
policy of England. He admits at the same time that it is to Britain
that they owe peace, and that it was Britain that protected them
from foreign invasion and saved them from continual civil strife.
Then comes most important evidence. President Brand of the Free
State recognised in the misgoverned Transvaal a subtle enemy.
Indeed, it is scarcely remembered that in 1857 the burghers of the
South African Republic invaded the Orange Free State territory
and declared that it belonged to them. Paul Kruger was subsequently
raised up, in the opinion of his followers, to be a Moses,
whose mission was to deliver &#8220;De Africander Natie&#8221; from British
bondage. Mr. Botha asks us to let him tear this veil of false
romance away. &#8220;We know him,&#8221; he tells us, &#8220;as an avaricious,
unscrupulous, and hypocritical man, who sacrificed a whole people
to his cupidity.&#8221; Krugerism spread over South Africa, using the
Bond, the press, and the pulpit to further its schemes.</p>

<span class="caption">AT THE HEAD OF UMGENI FALLS, HOWICK, NATAL.</span>
</div>

<p>Let it be fully understood&mdash;the Bond was the <i>fons</i> and <i>origo</i>
of the South African war&mdash;Krugerism powerfully co-operating.
The idea of the Africander Bond took root at the Paarl in the
Cape Colony in the years 1879 and 1880. Of course, as we have
seen, there was abundant preparation, but events in the Transvaal
hastened proceedings. Enthusiastic, educated men, such as Reitz,
Te Water, and the students of the Theological Seminary at Stellenbosch
felt patriotic desires wildly coursing in their veins, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
honour of formulating a definite plan of organisation belongs to the
Rev. S. J. du Toit, who then edited <i>De Patriot</i> newspaper at the
Paarl. <i>De Transvaalse Oorlag</i> was published by Messrs. D. T.
du Toit &amp; Co. of the Paarl in the year 1881. It was the
retrocession of the Transvaal under the direction of Mr. Gladstone
in the last-mentioned year that enabled the Bond to assume a very
definite shape, and to obtain immense and widespread power.</p>

<p>Carl Borckenhagen, editor of the <i>Bloemfontein Express</i>, and
F. W. Reitz, who succeeded Sir J. Brand as President of the
Orange Free State, and was subsequently State Secretary of the
Transvaal, earnestly joined the Bond. The former was a German,
whose honest and intense hatred of England was apparent in all
his leading articles, while the life-dream of the latter was to see the
establishment of the Dutch Republican United States of South Africa.</p>

<p>Branches of the Bond were formed in the Cape Colony, the
Transvaal, and the Orange Free State, and in 1882 the first
Congress of the Bond was held at Graaff Reinet. A very astute
and profoundly able plotter was already at work in the person of
Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr, who had started &#8220;The Farmers&#8217; Protection
Society&#8221; with the expressed purpose of watching over Dutch
farmers, and stirring them up to take an interest in politics.
Hitherto the Dutch bucolic mind had lain fallow. It was now
to be cultivated in order that it might produce fruit at parliamentary
elections, and, as a more powerful means to that end, &#8220;The
Farmers&#8217; Protection Society&#8221; was amalgamated with the Bond in
the year 1883. Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr then assumed the reins of
management, and, as a Member in the House of Assembly for
Stellenbosch, began to wield a power which at last developed into
that of a colonial Earl of Warwick, or king-maker. Ministries were
formed at his bidding, and cabinets accepted his control.</p>

<p>Certainly Mr. Hofmeyr very wisely and astutely modified the
ostensible objects of the Bond, and he was helped to do so by the
fact that the Hollander party in the Government at Pretoria became
stronger than the Africanders. Indeed, the Rev. S. J. Du Toit,
the founder of the Bond, was worsted in the Transvaal by the men
from the old country. But to make up for this, their march in the
Cape Colony was so triumphant that the President of the Bond at
the Paarl Congress in June 1900 was able to glory in the fact that
since 1884 the Cape Colony had been ruled under responsible
government almost exclusively by the aid of the Africander Bond.
In 1885 there were twenty-five Bond Members of Parliament who
held the balance of power, and there can be no doubt that Sir
Thomas Upington, Sir Gordon Sprigg, and Mr. Rhodes sought
and accepted their support.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mr. Rhodes became Prime Minister in 1890 he was in
harmony with the Bond, but certainly did not sympathise with its
real object. Each party masked its idea, and each party thought
that it was successfully using the other for its own objects. Objects
diametrically opposite: Mr. Rhodes desired the supremacy of the
British Imperial Power, and the Africander party really aimed at the
formation of a Republican South Africa.</p>

<p>The Bond, says Mr. Theo. Schreiner (&#8220;The Africander Bond,&#8221;
&amp;c., p. 29) was for many years the only organised political body in
the Cape Colony, and it exercised a political tyranny which crushed all
true political life and thought under its iron heel. While it deliberately
refused to take the reins of Government, it constantly aimed at
increasing the number of its Members in Parliament, and at making
it impossible for any Ministry to exist without its support. Arguing
apparently from facts, Sir Hercules Robinson, in his farewell speech
at Cape Town in April 1889, went so far as to say that there was no
longer any permanent place in South Africa for direct Imperial
rule.</p>

<p>A Bond Congress was held at Kimberley in 1891, when Mr.
Rhodes made a very bold but unsuccessful attempt to get the Dutch
to join with the English of the Cape Colony against the iniquitous
rule and anti-British policy of the South African Republic. Another
Congress was held at Port Elizabeth, when there was an attempt
made to capture the Bond by means of British friendship. Indeed
the changed attitude of this Association deceived many people, as
under the extremely able leadership of Mr. Hofmeyr it assumed the
position of a great benevolent society, which desired all Colonists,
both English and Dutch, to join it, in order to help forward the
progress of South Africa. Nevertheless, it is very significant that
the Rev. S. J. du Toit lost the high position he had previously held
in consequence of his supposed anti-Transvaal sympathies, and at
the same time the influence of the South African Republic greatly
increased. &#8220;Blood is thicker than water.&#8221; The close alliance of
sympathy more and more knit together the Dutchmen of the States
and of the Colonies.</p>

<p>But the Jameson Raid of 1895 removed every estrangement.
Just before this event President Kruger showed his hand by venturing
on a dangerous step, which really meant an open breach of the
Convention. He closed the drifts, or fords, by which goods carried
on the Cape and Natal railways entered the Transvaal, intending
by this act to force traffic over his own Delagoa Bay line. He was
informed by a joint ultimatum from the Imperial Government and
the Cape Colony that his action could not be permitted, and he
rescinded his declaration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not necessary to give a history of the Jameson Raid. No
event since Majuba had so much played into the hands of the party
in favour of an &#8220;Africander Natie.&#8221; Cromwell&#8217;s words when
General Leslie&#8217;s army left its strong position, &#8220;The Lord has
delivered them into our hands,&#8221; clearly expressed the sentiment
which on this occasion animated the minds of Bond members. The
Transvaal enormously increased its armaments, preparations for
war virtually commenced, and the entire sympathy of the Africander
party in the Cape Colony went out to their brethren of the South
African Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. Hofmeyr was a leader who thoroughly deserved the title of
&#8220;the mole,&#8221; as he metaphorically burrowed under the political platform,
and concealed his methods and aims with great subtlety. He
saw the danger of pursuing openly the programme expressed in the
motto of his party, and clothed the ideas of Africanderism in a
constitutional garb. However, when considering the real aim of the
Bond, we shall prove that this association never abandoned its
original programme.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that, in some respects, there is an analogy
between Daniel O&#8217;Connell, as leader of the Irish National party, and
J. H. Hofmeyr, the &#8220;Ons Jan&#8221; of Africanderism. Both ostensibly
were in favour of working only on constitutional lines, and both
were defeated by extremists, who saw no other way of obtaining
success than by recourse to arms. In the case of the Young Ireland
party, with such leaders as John Michell, Smith O&#8217;Brien, and Gavan
Duffy, a very futile insurrection was quickly crushed; while, so far
as J. H. Hofmeyr was concerned, a much greater conflagration
resulted. The great fire was really lit by him&mdash;at least he constantly
added fuel to it&mdash;and when too late made futile efforts to
extinguish the flames. O&#8217;Connell was much more honest, as he
openly opposed the Young Irelanders, and retired broken-hearted
from the arena.</p>

<p>Hofmeyr undoubtedly did not raise a finger to stop the furious
onward march of his party. <i>Ons Land</i> indeed encouraged this
movement, and the editor, Mr. Malun, was completely under the
great leader&#8217;s influence. Certainly at the end, as will be seen if the
correspondence ever comes to light, Hofmeyr tried to stop the mad
career of the Republics. No one saw more clearly than he did that
it was absolute folly to fight the British nation, but his interference
came too late.</p>

<p>O&#8217;Connell fought more straightforwardly. Never for a moment
did he admit that the policy of force was justifiable; while, on the
contrary, Hofmeyr had not the moral courage to step publicly into
the arena and denounce it. He was always occult in his mode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fighting. Unfortunately, in posing as a friend, he became the most
dangerous enemy of his own people.</p>

<p>The policy of the Africander Bond in the Cape Colony pandered
to mean interests and base prejudices. The corn farmers and
brandy producers were banded together in an unholy compact.
Heavy duties of five shillings per hundred pounds on flour and half-a-crown
on wheat were levied, while excise was abolished on spirits
made from the grape, in order that members of the Bond who grew
cereals and made very bad brandy might be benefited. The shameful
result was that bread became dear and bad alcohol cheap. As a
Nemesis the producers got into the hands of middlemen, and their
condition was rather injured than improved. In the case of both
wines and spirits, careless, unscientific methods were generally
adopted, quantity was preferred to quality, and in many cases acetous
fermentation resulted. Although spirit produced from the grape
paid not a farthing of excise, and was carried at a non-paying rate
on the railways, it was so miserably full of fusel oil and dangerous in
character as to be discarded generally by the white population,
and sent broadcast among the aboriginal natives for their degradation,
demoralisation, and destruction. In a shameful manner Mr.
Hofmeyr and the Bond politicians persistently resisted every proposed
law for the restriction of the sale of bad alcohol among
aboriginal natives, and indeed by insidious methods did all in their
power to remove every barrier between the native and the deadly
poison made carelessly in thousands of &#8220;pot stills&#8221; in the Dutch
districts of the Western Province.</p>

<p>At the same time the true Phariseeism of this people was demonstrated
by their fanatical observance of the Lord&#8217;s Day, which they
styled the Sabbath, and their absurd opposition to any Sunday trains,
even when absolutely necessary in general public interests. Mr.
Merriman, in one of his saner moments, reprobated this hypocrisy.</p>

</div>

<p>In South Africa the Native Laws Commission, which comprised
such men as Sir Thomas Upington, Sir Thomas Scanlen, and Sir
Jacob Barry, took evidence in a very complete form in the early
eighties, and as a result reported unanimously in favour of prohibiting
the sale of intoxicants to the aboriginal natives. Accordingly
by Act of Parliament this recommendation was given full effect to in
the Transkeian Territories. Subsequently the Drink Commission
reported in favour of this prohibition being extended to natives
throughout the Colony. In Bechuanaland and Basutoland, as well
as in Natal, the law was adopted long ago, and invariably worked
well; nevertheless, to the shame of the Bond organisation, it persistently
preferred Mammon to God, and in the strongest manner
opposed any legislation whose result would be to save the black man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
from destruction. Eventually an Act introduced by Sir James Rose
Innes was maimed before it was allowed to pass, so that licensing
Boards were only empowered to pass restrictive regulations on the
sale of alcohol to the coloured races &#8220;short of total prohibition.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the entire term of Bond rule in the Cape Colony not a
sixpence could be obtained for the encouragement of emigration
from the United Kingdom to the Cape Colony&mdash;nor would any land
be ever granted for the purpose. &#8220;Africa for the Africanders&#8221; has
a very real and exact meaning, and this was shown to demonstration
when even the petty vote for granting assisted passages to domestic
servants and artisans was objected to and refused. These people
might in many cases come from England, and therefore must be
shut out.</p>

<p>The subtlety and diplomacy of the Bond were evinced in voting
a grant for the British Navy, and Mr. Hofmeyr took many opportunities
of posing as a loyal subject, but, as we shall prove in the
context, the one great underlying principle of the organisation was
to obtain the mastery in South Africa. All nationalities were invited
to join. Africa must be made great by a union of all its
people, but those who read between the lines and ascertained the
real opinions of those who were guiding the movement knew
perfectly well that although the Imperial power might be allowed
at first to be a <i>faineant</i> king, the Mayor of the Palace with real
authority was to be the people of Dutch extraction&mdash;the Africanders&mdash;throughout
Southern Africa.</p>

<p>We now come to the last days before the war, when Lord Milner
could have been easily checkmated if Mr. Hofmeyr had been able
to influence the Republican Governments. As every one knew, Mr.
Kruger had positively promised equal franchise rights to British
subjects at the retrocession of the Transvaal, and this promise was
shamefully broken. In a constitutional manner the Uitlanders
vainly endeavoured to obtain redress, and now appealed to the
Imperial Government. The High Commissioner merely did his
evident duty, when at the Bloemfontein Conference he insisted
that at least a portion of the franchise rights promised should be
given. No doubt Mr. Hofmeyr would have seen his opportunity
here, and have consented in such a manner, and with such a purpose,
as to really render British interference nugatory, but the
Dutch Republicans had now the bit between their teeth. They
were the Lord&#8217;s people, they had made all their preparations, and
were perfectly sure of victory. Mr. Kruger himself could not now
stop the war, and the astounding ultimatum came forth from the
little Republic to the great Empire: &#8220;Recall your troops and send
no more, or we will punish you.&#8221; If this gage had not been taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
up the United Kingdom would have been forced to take a back seat
as a third-class power among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>Having referred to the origin and growth of the Africander
party, we must now consider its aims. It must be admitted that
its originators were perfectly candid. We find them declaring in
<i>De Patriot</i> in 1882, when referring to Confederation, that &#8220;There
is just one hindrance, and that is the British flag. Let them take
that away, and within a year the confederation under the free Africander
flag will be established. The British must just have Simon&#8217;s
Bay as a naval and military station on the road to India, and give
over all the rest of Africa to the Africanders.... It is we on top
or they on top. They must be under or we under.... Two
things are wanted, artillery for the Transvaal ... to make their
own ammunition and to be well supplied with cannon. Now that
the war against the English Government is over (at Majuba Hill),
the war against the English language must begin. By Anglifying
the girls they infect the whole family life with the English speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must now put into the box witnesses of a very important
character whose testimony, so far as the aims of the Bond are concerned,
is perfectly unexceptionable. These witnesses are Mr.
Burgers, President of the South African Republic, Sir John Brand,
President of the Orange Free State, Mr. Reitz, State Secretary of
the South African Republic and previously President of the Orange
Free State, and Mr. Steyn, Attorney-General and subsequently
President of the Orange Free State. In 1875 President Burgers
stated at a meeting held in Holland to consider the Delagoa Bay
railway scheme, that he hoped to see a New Holland eight millions
strong in South Africa, whence England shall have been expelled.
It was President Brand who said, &#8220;Bartle Frere dreams of United
South Africa under the British flag; and so do I, but not under the
same flag.&#8221; And when conducting a controversy with Kruger
on the subject of a Customs Union, Sir John Brand, disgusted with
treachery, cried aloud, &#8220;The Bond seeks to raise a Republican
flag in a country with which we are at peace.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Theo. Schreiner, whose honesty and truthfulness no man
in South Africa will deny, furnishes us with a circumstantial account
of an interview between himself and Mr. Reitz in the early eighties.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Then Mr. Reitz was a judge at Bloemfontein, and was one of that
band of Africander patriots whose aspiration and conduct remind us
naturally of the aims, objects, and aspirations of the Young Ireland
party under Smith O&#8217;Brien. After in vain trying to enlist Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Schreiner as a recruit, Mr. Reitz asked him to state the reason of
his refusal. The reply was, &#8220;Because the ultimate object aimed at
was the overthrow of British power and the expulsion of the British
flag from South Africa.&#8221; &#8220;Well, what if it is so?&#8221; was the rejoinder,
to which Mr. Schreiner replied, &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose, do you, that
the flag is going to disappear without a tremendous struggle and
fight?&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Reitz, &#8220;I suppose not, but what
of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Steyn, of the Orange Free State, made the following statement
to the Rev. W. Tees, Presbyterian Minister in Durban:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Britain has been completely taken by surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir, this has been preparing since the year 1884.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;In both States?&#8221; asked the clergyman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;in both, and in the Colony also. The Transvaal
has been the arsenal, but those in the know in the Free State
and in the Colony have worked in unison with Kruger. The object
was to oust the British from South Africa, but it was not intended
to do it all at once. The first step was the consolidation of the two
Republics as a Sovereign International State, and later on an
Africander rising at the right moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Tees then asked a very pertinent question. &#8220;Then do you
mean to say that when President Kruger attended the Bloemfontein
Conference he knew perfectly well that the proceedings were a farce,
and that he really meant to fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Steyn&#8217;s reply was &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a conference between the Governments of the South African
Republic and Orange Free States held in 1887<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> relative to railways,
we find Mr. Kruger declaring: &#8220;If you hook on to the Colony you
cut our throat.... Let us speak frankly; we are not going to be
dependent on England.&#8221; Mr. Wolmarans, following, declared:
&#8220;We have had much experience of her Majesty&#8217;s Government, and
we will and must shake ourselves free. We are still insufficiently
prepared. We wish to get to the sea, especially with an eye to
future complications&mdash;you know our secret policy.&#8221; Subsequently the
blunt soldier, General Joubert, said on the occasion of an Uitlander
complaining to him of the constant breach of Article 14 of the 1884
Convention providing equality of treatment for the Uitlanders:
&#8220;Equality! We don&#8217;t want equality! We want to see who is
to be boss in South Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apropos to this subject it is not uninteresting to note from the
debates in the Volksraad of the South African Republic (see the
<i>Johannesburg Star</i> of August 17, 1895) that the laws of the Trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>vaal
were intended to make the acquisition of the franchise by
Uitlanders morally impossible, and that at the end of one debate Mr.
Otto merely became the mouthpiece of the Burghers when he said,
without any rebuke from the chairman, &#8220;Come on and fight. I say,
come on and have it out; and the sooner the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must now put in documentary evidence to prove the real
aims and objects of the Africander Bond. The declaration of the
Rev. S. J. Du Toit, Judge Reitz, and Carl Borckenhagen is perfectly
explicit. They declare that &#8220;The object of the Africander Bond
is the establishment of a South African Nationality through the
cultivation of a true love of this our fatherland. This object must
be attained by the promotion and defence of the national language,
and by Africanders, both politically and socially, making their power
to be felt as a nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the retrocession of the Transvaal the &#8220;Africander Natie&#8221;
took a very definite shape, as we find the <i>Patriot</i> newspaper
declaring that &#8220;God&#8217;s hand has been visible in a more marked
manner than ever before seen since the days of the children of
Israel. Proud England is compelled to give the Boers back their
land after they had been defeated by a mere handful.&#8221; The little
respect which Africanders entertained for British troops had entirely
departed.</p>

<p>One of the articles of the Bond programme of principles contained
the following words: &#8220;In itself acknowledging no single form
of Government as the only suitable form, and whilst acknowledging
the form of Government existing at present, it (the Bond) means
that the aim of our national development must be a United South
Africa under its own flag.&#8221; With the subtlety which always distinguished
the party, a change was made in this some years afterwards.</p>

<p>The language of the Bond organ, <i>De Patriot</i>, is perfectly explicit,
and shows very clearly the spirit and intentions of the party.
The English must be boycotted. There must be no English shops,
signboards, advertisements, or bookkeepers. Manufacture of munitions
of war must be started in the two Republics. &#8220;At Heidelberg
there are already 4000 cartridges made daily, and a few skilful
Africanders have begun to make shells too. That is right; so we
must become a nation.&#8221; It must be considered a disgrace to speak
English, and war must be waged in the Church against that language.
&#8220;It is the Dutch Reformed Church. What has England to do with
it?&#8221; In family life no quarter was to be given.</p>

</div>

<p>As we have already said, the junction of the Farmers&#8217; Protection
Society with the Bond exercised a moderating influence, but the
spirit, intentions, and object of the party remained the same, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Mr. J. H. Hofmeyr attempted, in a manner as astute as it was dangerous,
to unite the Dutch and English people in South Africa in a
common antagonism to Great Britain&#8217;s power, influence, and presence.
Even Mr. Merriman saw through this trick, as he declared in a
speech delivered at Grahamstown in 1885. &#8220;It is now the cue of the
Bond to pretend to be loyal, and if it were not painful it would be
ridiculous to hear the editor of <i>De Zuid Afrikaan</i> cheering the
Queen, and to hear Du Toit praying for her while resolutions are
passed round to the branches in direct opposition to the honour of
England.... Each one of you will have to make up his mind
whether he is prepared to see the colony remain a part of the
British Empire, which carries with it obligations as well as privileges,
or whether he is prepared to obey the dictates of the Bond. From
the very first time, some years ago, when first the poison began to
be distilled in this country, I felt that it must come to this: Was
England or the Transvaal to be the paramount force in South
Africa?... What could they think of the objects of the Bond
when they found Judge Reitz advocating a Republic of South
Africa under one flag?... No one who wishes well to the British
Government could have read the leading articles of the <i>Zuid
Afrikaan</i> and <i>Express</i> and <i>De Patriot</i>, in expounding the Bond
principles, without seeing that the maintenance of law and order
under the British Crown and the object they have in view are
absolutely different things.... My quarrel with the Bond is that
it stirs up race difference. Its main object is to make the South
African Republic the paramount power in South Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>To do justice to the Bond, we must quote Mr. Theron, their
secretary, who is reported by the <i>South African News</i> of May 5,
1900, to have said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;One other question may be asked, &#8216;What is the object of the
Bond?&#8217; My reply is, its object, its only object, is expressed in
sec. 2 of the General Constitution, which is worded as follows:
&#8216;The nearest object of the Bond is the formation of a South
African Nationality by means of union and co-operation, as a
preparation for the ultimate object, a united South Africa. The
Bond tries to attain this object by constitutional means, giving to
respective governments and legislatures all the support they are
entitled to, and respecting everybody&#8217;s rights.&#8217;&#8221; This was
perfectly understood. It was a Dutch Nationality and a Dutch
Republican South Africa that was aimed at, and the context fully
proved this assertion when the vast majority of the Bond party
fought against England, either as belligerents in the Republics or
as rebels&mdash;active and passive&mdash;within the Cape Colony. Nine
out of every ten ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
rebels, according to the testimony of one of their own number&mdash;the
Rev. Mr. Vlok of Piquetberg. In such circumstances it is
impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the departure
from the original, straightforward declaration of the aims of the
Bond was nothing but a diplomatic effort to throw dust in the
eyes of the enemy.</p>

<p>Certainly such a man as Mr. Cronwright Schreiner was in
no way deceived by this attitude, as we find him saying in 1893<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
that the Africander Bond is anti-English in its aims; its officers
and its language are Dutch, and it is striving to gain such power
as absolutely to control the Cape Parliament. It had &#8220;paralysed
our political life.&#8221; &#8220;In fact,&#8221; he goes on to say, &#8220;the Bond has
sacrificed the welfare of the country for years to the selfish attainment
of one object, namely, the supremacy of the Dutch-speaking
inhabitants of the Cape Colony, regardless of the rights of others;
the imagined good of an ignorant clique of the Dutch has been
preferred to the good of the country. These men must not have
power; they are wholly unfit to have it. The Bond is a body
striving solely for its own benighted ends, and founded and
conducted on race lines.&#8221; This was a correct judgment passed
from the English Cape Colony farmer&#8217;s point of view; men who,
quite unlike the pro-Boers in England, perfectly understood their
subject by means of adequate evidence obtained on the spot, as
well as by bitter personal experience.</p>

<p>Can anything be more significant than the following facts.
The Hon. Mr. Bellingan, a Dutch member of the Legislative
Council, in the session immediately previous to the war is reported
by the <i>Cape Times</i> to have said: &#8220;If the policy of annexation were
adhered to, they (the Africanders) would take advantage of
England&#8217;s calamity;&#8221; while the Bond paper, <i>Ons Land</i>, reports the
honourable member as saying that when the Queen came to die
and storms burst over the empire the Africanders would not side
with England if the Republics were annexed. Then the member
himself, in a letter to the <i>Cape Times</i>, declared that what he said
was: &#8220;He saw difficulty for the British Empire after the death of
our beloved Queen. By giving the Republicans their independence
England could reckon upon them as friends, but if the Republics
were annexed she could not do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bond undoubtedly during many years prepared the
materials for a conflagration. The great never-dying, ever-present
aspiration was fully expressed in its motto, &#8220;Africa for the
Africanders.&#8221; It was nothing if not diplomatic, and professed very
loudly a loyalty which showed itself in its true colours when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Bond party was in power just prior to the war. Then we find its
aims exhibited by the Bond party in Parliament, backed up by the
Bond Congress, fighting most strenuously against the absurdly
lenient provisions of the Treason Bill.</p>

<p>As Mr. Theo. Schreiner aptly says, &#8220;Rebellion in fact is no
rebellion in the eyes of the Bond so long as it be in accord with the
Africander national ideal.&#8221; The ministers of their political party
allowed ammunition and guns to be carried to the Republics over
the railways of the Colony in immense quantities, and the W. P.
Schreiner ministry was split up rather than consent to the very
mild punishment of deprivation of the franchise being inflicted on
rebels. Then came the war, when a large majority of the Bond
party were either active or passive rebels.</p>

<p>But no one more clearly points out the real objects of the Bond
than Mr. Reitz, one of its original founders, and to the end one of
its principal leaders. He does not hesitate to say in his brochure
entitled &#8220;A Century of Wrong,&#8221; largely circulated in more than
one language over the continent of Europe:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;May the hope which glowed in our hearts during 1880, and
which buoyed us up during that struggle, burn on steadily. May
it prove a beacon of light in our path, invincibly moving onwards
through blood and through tears until it leads us to a real union of
South Africa.... Whether the result be victory or death, liberty
will assuredly rise in South Africa ... just as freedom dawned
over the United States of America a little more than a century
ago. Then from Zambesi to Simonstown it will be &#8216;<span class="smcap">Africa for
the Africander</span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>A Bond object-lesson was really to be seen in a practical manner
in the South African Republic under the rule of Dutch Africanders.
There indeed the Transvaal portion of Africa was clearly ruled for
one section of the population&mdash;the Africander&mdash;to the utter exclusion
of the rights of the English population largely in a majority within
Johannesburg. There was an election system leading to the corrupt
and unjust rule of Boer Raads and a Boer oligarchy. Protection,
Concessions, the Master and Servants Acts were all managed in
accordance with Africander ideas. Bond views of native policy
were carried out in such a way that no coloured person however
civilised could vote, nor hold title to fixed property nor trade freely,
nor even marry as white people might. All this found encouragement
in the Cape Colony, and eventually the absurd fiction of Boers
fighting for liberty in the Transvaal was proclaimed as a fact over
all Europe, although literally they commenced a war in which they
felt sure of success for the purpose of subverting liberty and
obtaining complete freedom to carry on government by a section of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the people purely for the interests of a section&mdash;the Africanders&mdash;ignoring
altogether equal rights for all other men.</p>

<p>When we consider clearly and definitely all the facts, remember
that history repeats itself and that the Africanders are profoundly
tenacious of their political opinions and have proved themselves to
be a people who are able to wait, can we not see at once how desirable
it is to suspend temporarily the constitution of the Cape Colony? The
body politic requires a physician. No one better understands the
subject or is more competent to prescribe than Lord Milner. Why
do we not take his advice? Nothing is more significant than the
fact that in the Cape Colony two years ago heated parliamentary
debates and a violent political agitation, following immediately upon
the suppression of the first rebellion, were in their turn succeeded by
a second rebellion more ruinous than the former one.</p>

<p>In asking for suspension there is no idea of defection from the
principle of responsible government. The Imperial system requires
local independence, and in due course this will be extended to all
parts of South Africa. A necessary interregnum is required for
purposes of true liberty and sound rule, in order that breakdown
may be prevented and true constitutionalism take the place of the
tyranny of any section of the population. The Imperial Government
is no step-mother, and the federation of Southern Africa will
doubtless be on similar lines to those of the Canadian Dominion.
Certainly no system will be forced upon the people contrary to their
wishes, but the resurrection of Bond power in the Cape Colony
would absolutely prevent any well-considered and statesmanlike
plan, in which all men would receive fair play utterly regardless of
race extraction. In fact the British and the Africander Bond
theories are diametrically opposed. The first makes every
civilised man equal from the Zambesi to Cape Town, the other
specially and always means &#8220;Africa for the Africanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heated discussions in Parliament, and the intense excitement
connected with contested elections, cannot but accentuate race hatred
in the Cape Colony. Surely South Africa should have a rest. As
in the Transvaal and in the Orange Colony, so at the Cape, the
great healer, time, ought to be allowed to do its work.</p>

<p>But perhaps the strongest, because the most practical, argument
in favour of &#8220;suspension&#8221; is based upon the fact that a re-distribution
Act is absolutely necessary if fair play is to be bestowed on
all nationalities, and the reign of the Bond be not allowed to again
become supreme. The suspensionists are really fighting for liberty
against the rule of a section. Their motto is that of the Union
Jack&mdash;&#8220;Equal rights for all&#8221;&mdash;whereas, as we know, the Africanders
will in the future, as in the past, demand &#8220;Africa for the Africanders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>&#8221;
No delusion is greater than to imagine that they will change their
purpose. Their plan is to adhere to their principles, consolidate
their party, and wait for an opportunity. After spending more than
two hundred millions of money, and much more than this&mdash;40,000
noble lives&mdash;for the sake of upholding British supremacy in Southern
Africa, nothing should be done even to risk a recurrence of the
trouble. This certainly was the opinion of Lord Milner, and of the
great majority of the British people in the Cape Colony. The
advice now referred to was not taken, and history must record the
result.</p>

<p>The real aims and objects of the Bond are as decipherable
to-day as they were three years or ten years ago. The people
who belong to it are thoroughly tenacious of these opinions, and
to do them justice, make no pretence of having changed them.
At the Paarl the popular General Botha has just declared that
they are not vanquished, retain their traditions, and will yet
conquer. They look with unutterable scorn on the men who
joined the National Scouts, and entertain feelings of coldness
and dislike for those who did not join the enemy either actively
or passively. In the great Dutch Church of Cape Town, the
Republican Generals received an unanimous ovation, and were
carried shoulder high, in triumph, from the edifice. The truth
is that the Bond exists, remains extremely powerful, and is only
waiting and watching for an opportunity.</p>

<p>British rule is now comparatively easy both in the Transvaal
and Orange Colonies. Effective progress is being made under
the rule of wise and firm Governments; but it is in the Cape
Colony, where a treacherous and powerful enemy is allowed to
plot with impunity, that the real danger to British Imperial
interests lies.</p>

<p>How history repeats itself! When the fatuous policy of
abandoning 35,000 square miles of excellent territory styled
the Orange River Sovereignty was pursued in 1853, there was
only one man in the House of Commons who opposed it,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
subsequent circumstances amply justified his judgment. In 1902,
Mr. Chamberlain would have found it absolutely impossible to
obtain a majority in the House of Commons favourable to suspension
of the Cape Colony Constitution. What is now to be done?
Our answer is, &#8220;Accept with loyalty the decision of the Government,
and show by wise moderation that we are most desirous to
be friends with our fellow-subjects of Dutch extraction. No recriminations
nor abuse should proceed from our side. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
will please us better than to find the Bond abandoned and all
men cordially uniting as one free people under the British flag.
If this be not done&mdash;and masses of the people have already declared
that it will not&mdash;we will have to fight the Bond again at
elections, on public platforms, and in the press, as well as in
Parliament. It would have been well for both nationalities if
this could have been avoided, but this is now impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By</span> E. F. KNIGHT</p>

<p class="center small"><i>Author of &#8220;Where Three Empires Meet&#8221;; &#8220;The Cruise of the &#8216;Falcon,&#8217;&#8221; &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In all the long romantic story of the making of the British
Empire, no episode more strongly appeals to the imagination
than the foundation of Rhodesia. Well is it named Rhodesia;
for the history of Great Britain&#8217;s acquisitions on either side of
the Zambesi, the 750,000 square miles of magnificent territories
which lie under the sway of the British South Africa Company, is
the history of the Englishman, Cecil John Rhodes: had it not been
for whose foresight, statesmanship, untiring vigilance, determined
but patient endeavour for years towards the accomplishment of his
mighty schemes, the South African Plateau, with its gold-bearing
reefs, its vast tracts of rich arable and pastoral lands, would have
fallen into the hands of one or other of the foreign Powers which
keenly contested with him its possession.</p>

<p>It is a trite saying that when the time is ripe for great doings on
the part of a nation the necessary man invariably appears. It is a
saying hardly warranted by fact, for many a golden opportunity
have nations, Great Britain as often as others, lost because the
right man was not forthcoming. Happily it has not been so in
South Africa. It is almost certain that, had it not been for the
accident of Mr. Rhodes seeking the South African shores for his
health when a lad, the Germans and the Boers would have cut off
the Cape Colony from all possibility of expansion to the north.
Those Powers had even found their right men. The Transvaal had
her stubborn Kruger; Germany had her shrewd and energetic
agents and explorers preparing the way to annexation in different
portions of the Dark Continent; while even Portugal had her
D&#8217;Andrade, a man who displayed much of the spirit and enterprise
of the Portuguese discoverers and conquerors of olden days. Cecil
Rhodes took his place in South African affairs but just in time.
The Transvaal War had been followed by a period of extraordinary
apathy both in England and in the Cape Colony. No one seemed
to care in the least what became of the territory lying beyond our
then limits. At home men were sick of the very name of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Africa. Many would have gladly abandoned all our possessions
about the Cape of Storms, and abdicated an Empire which seemed
to bring us nothing but futile wars, disaster, and disgrace. It was
at this critical period that Mr. Rhodes came to the front to save our
supremacy in South Africa&mdash;too late, indeed, to save for us much that
should have been ours; too late, for example, to secure our sovereignty
over Namaqualand and Damaraland, territories which had been long
recognised as being within Britain&#8217;s sphere of influence, which
formerly had been annexed to the Cape, but which latterly had
been totally neglected both by the Imperial and Cape Governments,
so that the watchful Germans were left at liberty, first to establish
their trading missions, and finally to assert their sovereignty over
those extensive regions.</p>

<p>The richness and beauty of the highlands, extending over an
immense area both north and south of the Zambesi, had for many
years been known to both English and Boer travellers. Mr.
Rhodes, in his early days at Kimberley, met many an adventurous
wanderer who had come from that wonderful region, and their
glowing tales perhaps first inspired in him that ambitious dream
of the creation of a great new British colony that should include
all the finest country in South and Central Africa. As far back as
1882, having commenced to take an active part in Cape politics,
Mr. Rhodes took the initial steps towards the attainment of the one
absorbing purpose of his life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Of fascinating interest is the story&mdash;a story for the most part yet
untold to the world&mdash;of Cecil Rhodes&#8217; long struggle with the Boers
and Portuguese who attempted to keep the Empire-builder out of
the Promised Land, and of his frequent forestallings of further
German expansion at our expense. The first, the most critical and
anxious period of all, was occupied with the contest for the very gate
of the country, the right-of-way to the north, which we were so
nearly losing, and without which our advance would have been hopelessly
barred. The only outlet to the north from the Cape Colony
lay through Bechuanaland, a vast region that was divided into
several independent native kingdoms, and hemmed in between the
Germans, then advancing from the west, and the Transvaal Boers
on the east. This gateway to the north has been likened to the
neck of a bottle; the narrow neck which, once passed, opens out
into the broad and precious Zambesia. Kruger, clever and
obstinate, commenced his career of attempted expansion by
seizing this neck with the intention of thus cutting us off completely
from the north. It was his ambition to extend the Boer rule
westward to the German line, eastward to Delagoa Bay and the
Indian Ocean, and northwards over the steppes of Zambesia.
Pretorius had declared that the Transvaal had no boundary on
the west, unless it were the Atlantic Ocean. The first struggle
therefore between Rhodes and Kruger was for this vital point of
vantage, the neck. Had Kruger grasped it the British flag would
never have floated on the northern plateau, the Boers and Germans
would have joined hands&mdash;there had been a talk of a German
Protectorate over the Transvaal&mdash;and theirs, not ours, would have
been the splendid prize. And what is more, seeing what a vast
conspiracy had been organised against us, we should probably have
lost the Cape Colony itself: the foundations of our Empire would
have been shaken. Immense was the threatening peril to which we
shut our eyes. The Transvaal War had left the Cape Colonists in
a distinctly anti-British frame of mind. Disgusted at the follies of
the Imperial Government, even those of British blood sympathised
with the Transvaal Boers, and had no objection to the north
falling into the hands of the Dutch Republicans. Indeed, the
general feeling at the Cape at that time appears to have been
republican. Cecil Rhodes had not only to out-man&oelig;uvre Germany,
the Transvaal, and Portugal, but had also to overcome the
opposition of colonial prejudice, and the complete indifference of the
English to all affairs South African. He stood almost alone, and
had to create a party for himself. Not only man of action, but
diplomatist and opportunist in the best sense of the word, he played
his game with wondrous skill, and succeeded at last in winning over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the reluctant colonists to his views. The very Africander Bond
became his ally for a time.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Cape to Cairo Railway. Laying the Rails</span>
</div>

<p>That struggle for the neck of Bechuanaland is an interesting
story that cannot be told here. First Kruger attempted to establish
himself in Mankoroane&#8217;s territory. Mankoroane, to protect himself,
offered to cede his country to the Cape Colony, which point-blank
refused it. Rhodes, in 1882, went himself to the chieftain,
and so arranged matters that the Imperial Government found
itself compelled to take over the district. Thwarted at this point,
Kruger attempted to cut us off further to the north, and sent his
agents to establish the freebooting republics of Goshen and Stellaland.
Again Rhodes checked him. Going himself to Stellaland,
he persuaded the Boers in possession to accept the British flag on
the condition that our Government ratified their titles to the land
they had occupied. The Warren expedition, despatched at last in
consequence of the strong representations of Rhodes and his far-seeing
ally, Sir Hercules Robinson, the then High Commissioner,
resulted in the expulsion of the Boer freebooters from Montsioa&#8217;s
country, where Mafeking now stands, and the extension of our
protectorate over the whole of Bechuanaland. Then Rhodes
arranged for the taking over of Khama&#8217;s land, and the gateway to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the north was won. Foiled again, and thus hemmed in on the west,
the stubborn Kruger sent his very able agent Grobler to Lobengula
to obtain from him a Matabele concession to the Transvaal. Rhodes
found that it was hopeless to attempt to bring the Imperial Government
to a sense of the danger of the position, so now, before it
was too late, he had to act promptly for himself. He sent Maguire
Thomson and Rudd to Lobengula to obtain a concession from him
before Grobler had carried out his mission. They were successful;
the Governor ratified the concession. Dr. Jameson and Dr. Harris
went to Matabeleland to deliver to the king the stipulated arms and
ammunition; and despite the bitter opposition of the Cape statesman
and consistently anti-British Englishman, Mr. Merriman, the
deed of concession was sealed, and its validity was recognised by the
Government. And thus in 1888, after years of patient endeavour,
Cecil Rhodes at last had made the way clear for the realisation of his
mighty scheme.</p>

<p>The sinews of war had now to be found; and Rhodes, in anticipation,
before the granting of the concession, had made his
provisions. First he had brought about the amalgamation of the
diamond-mining companies, and then, as head of the great De Beers
Corporation with its rent-roll of four millions sterling a year, he, in
1887, effected the alteration of the De Beers Trust Deed by a
liquidation of the Company, so as to give the De Beers directors
power to apply the Company&#8217;s funds to outside objects, that is,
to the development of the North. Messrs. Barnato and Beit
agreed to this on the condition of being made life governors, and
ever since loyally co-operated with Rhodes in the execution of his
scheme.</p>

<p>The next step was the granting of the charter by the British
Government in 1889, and the creation of the British South Africa
Company. Then Rhodes sent out the famous Pioneer Expedition to
Mashonaland, and the white men established themselves in Rhodesia.
It must be borne in mind that at that time and for years afterwards
Rhodes had to be ever closely watching and cunningly circumventing
the German Boers and Portuguese, who spared no effort to keep
us from the north. Bismarck&#8217;s agent, Count Pffeil, was sent on a
secret mission to South Africa and all but succeeded in anticipating
Rhodes, and in winning for Germany a broad strip of territory that
would have connected her eastern and western possessions, so
forming a bar across Africa from ocean to ocean that would have
effectually shut us out. Then there was the Boer trek into
Mashonaland in 1891, when the Rhodesians guarded the drifts
against the invaders&mdash;a scheme of Kruger&#8217;s that was frustrated
without the shedding of blood. Even when the Pioneer Expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
was on its way, the energetic Portuguese D&#8217;Andrade was distributing
the flags of his country among the chiefs, and attempting to get
concessions that would cut Mashonaland off from Matabeleland.
To defeat his plans Rhodes entered into a treaty with Umtassa, and
obtained the Gazaland concession from Gungunyana, a concession
which would have extended the Chartered Company&#8217;s possessions
to the shores of the Indian Ocean had not Lord Salisbury refused
to ratify it and acknowledged the claims of Portugal. Then again
in 1889 Rhodes, whose Intelligence Department always supplied him
in good time with information as to the doings of his rivals, hearing
that Germany intended to cut us off at the head of Lake Nyassa,
secretly sent Mr. H. H. Johnson to hoist British flags at Port Abercorn
on Lake Tanganyika and other places, as proof of our occupation.
The Portuguese also hoped to erect a wall against our expansion by
connecting her eastern and western territories, and for this purpose
an expedition set out from Angola to seize the Barotse country, but
here Rhodes again forestalled them; his mission was the first to
arrive in the country, and Barotseland was placed under our protection.
The way these things were done by Rhodes&#8217; agents, the
hardships endured, the perils incurred by these adventurous men
who&mdash;unlike the Portuguese agents who were always accompanied
by large bands of armed men&mdash;plunged alone into these savage
regions to carry out their hazardous missions, makes a wonderful
story indeed of British pluck and enterprise.</p>

<p>The Pioneer Expedition set out in June 1890. The Pioneer
Column, which had been enrolled by Major Frank Johnson, consisted
of 187 men who had decided to try their fortunes in the new
country, and it was accompanied by 650 mounted police, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Pennefather. The famous hunter,
Selous, acted as guide. The ox-waggons carried provisions and
other stores sufficient to supply the whole force for six months.
For four hundred miles the Pioneers marched into Mashonaland,
constructing a road as they went, and making drifts at the many
rivers to enable the waggons to cross. Forts were built at intervals,
and small garrisons were left in them. At last they came to their
objective point, Mount Hampden; and hard by it they built Fort
Salisbury, now the capital of all Rhodesia. The Pioneer Force was
now disbanded, each man receiving, in addition to his pay, the
right to peg out fifteen gold claims and 3000 acres of land. The
men scattered over the country, prospecting for gold and pegging
out their claims and farms. The first rainy season was a terrible
one for them; it was an exceptionally bad year; all transport was
interrupted, supplies fell short; the men had to live on native foodstuffs;
great privations were endured; many died; and, as in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
other part of our Empire, the ways of Rhodesia are strewn with the
bones of the men who won the land for their country.</p>

<p>But the men who go out as the pioneers of the Empire are not
easily discouraged. The settlement and development of the country
was at once undertaken with energy. Arrangements were made
for the administration of the new State; a legal system was created;
roads were constructed; mining plant was brought up; mining
operations commenced; land was brought under cultivation; stores
were opened; townships were surveyed, and rose rapidly from the
wilderness, handsome brick buildings taking the place of the huts
in which the pioneers roughed it at first. But the development of
the country was much retarded by the difficulty of communication
and the enormous cost of transport. Little could be done until
Rhodesia was afforded railway communication with the coast; so
Mr. Rhodes made arrangements for the extension of the Cape
railway from its then terminus at Kimberley, and for the construction
of a line to Beira on the east coast.</p>

<p>The Chartered Company had not long effected its active occupation
of Mashonaland before the Matabele impis resumed their murderous
raids on the Mashonas, and in 1893 the Matabele war broke
out, leading to the overthrow of Lobengula and the absorption of
Matabeleland by the Chartered Company. Nearly every able-bodied
white man in Mashonaland volunteered his services. Three
columns, numbering nine hundred men in all, marched through the
country, defeating the Matabele impis on the Shangani and Zambesi;
Bulawayo was occupied, and with the gallant stand of Wilson
and his little force, the war was brought to a conclusion.</p>

<p>Then the white man&#8217;s city began to rise from the veldt, hard by
the burnt kraal of Lobengula. Towards the close of the war I
travelled in an ox-waggon with some Boer transport riders from the
Marico Valley in the Transvaal&mdash;about thirty miles from Mafeking&mdash;to
Bulawayo. This beautiful valley (&#8220;the Granary of the Transvaal&#8221;)
was the old home of Moselekatse, Lobengula&#8217;s father. It
was a fat land; there is none so rich for a hundred leagues around;
for tribes of Zulu blood will establish themselves in none but the
best country, and they will trek far to find it. The rolling land
of Marico is as fertile as it is beautiful. It is as green as Devon,
and the pretty farmhouses of the prosperous people are scattered
among rich pastures, great fields of corn, and fruit orchards. Fifty
years ago the Boers and their Baralong allies drove Moselekatse
and his raiding warriors out of Marico, and sent them trekking
north to seek a new home. So northward they travelled, murdering
and cattle-lifting as they went, traversing good country, but not such
as would satisfy the Zulu, until at last, nearly five hundred miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
from Marico, they came to a land even more favoured than that
they had left, and settled down in what is now called Matabeleland.
I followed their route, and could then understand their
choice. Fair indeed to the eye appears the green, well-watered
high veldt of Matabeleland as the traveller from the south opens
it out on reaching the watershed between the Crocodile and the
Zambesi rivers. Lieutenant Maund, who some years before had
been sent to spy out Matabeleland, with justice reported that,
&#8220;when compared to the country south of it, it was as Canaan after
the wilderness.&#8221; When I reached the place where Bulawayo, with
its stately buildings, now stands, I found a few hundred white men
occupying a little temporary settlement of native huts and tattered
tents that had sprung up round the newly-constructed fort; the
building of the modern city had not commenced. A little later I
was present at the first auction of township stands. The alternate
land lots bearing even numbers, lining one side of what was to
be the chief street, were sold. They fetched about £50 apiece.
A few months afterwards the alternate stands bearing odd numbers
were sold by auction; they all fetched over £400 apiece, the
highest price realised being £900. Some of the stands, that could
have been purchased for £50 each in 1893, are at the present time
worth six or seven thousand pounds apiece, and realise that price
when put on the market. I quote these figures to show that whatever
critics at home may think of the future of Rhodesia, those on
the spot have confidence in it. The Matabele War was scarcely
over before the volunteers, having received their mining, farm, and
loot rights, scattered over the country to prospect and peg out
their claims. It was wonderful to observe how quickly, under
Dr. Jameson&#8217;s able administration, everything was put in order,
and Matabeleland began to assume the aspect of a settled country.
Bulawayo was soon a fine city, having its water-works, electric
lighting, hospitals, public schools, its imposing court-house and
other handsome public buildings. Townships sprang up like mushrooms
all over the high veldt in the vicinity of the gold-bearing reefs.
The population rapidly increased. The Chartered Company, in the
meanwhile, pushed on the railway from Mafeking towards Bulawayo,
proceeded to construct the line from Umtali to Beira, and quickly
placed Bulawayo into telegraphic communication with the outer
world. And now there was every sign of prosperity; the development
of the gold mines gave encouraging results; trade was good;
the value of the land for farming was proved, and excellent crops
were raised; Rhodesia&#8217;s future seemed assured. But it was fated
that its progress should be retarded by an extraordinary succession
of disasters; surely no new country was ever so sorely tried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>All was going well until the early part of 1896, when the first of
its many scourges swept down on the unhappy land&mdash;the dreaded
rinderpest came from the North, and despite every precaution that
could be taken to prevent its spreading, it destroyed over 90 per
cent. of the cattle in the country, and played like havoc among the
wild game. It is difficult for one who was not in Rhodesia at the
time to realise the magnitude of this misfortune. As this was a
land then entirely dependent upon oxen for transport, a stoppage
was put to agricultural and mining operations; and the cattle-owning
native population suffered greatly. Before the rinderpest
broke out the average price of an ox in Rhodesia was £6, and now,
though it is over five years since the rinderpest was stamped out,
the price is about £28. Transport rates rose from 10s. to £5 per
100 lbs., and all the necessaries of life went up to famine prices.
These figures, which will be found in an interesting pamphlet
written by Mr. P. S. Inskip of the British South Africa Company&#8217;s
service, will convey some idea of the situation. Absolute ruin faced
the settlers; it is wonderful that the bulk of them did not abandon
the country in despair, but pioneers are not easily disheartened, and
they stubbornly struggled on, taking every possible measure to
mitigate the effect of the plague.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Rhodesian Natives Washing Clothes</span>
</div>

<p>But misfortune followed on misfortune. The rinderpest was
raging when the Matabele rose, and the Rhodesians had to suppress
a formidable rebellion, which was rendered the more difficult to cope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
with by the scarcity of oxen. The white settlers were massacred in
outlying districts; there were heroic rescues, the rising spread to
Mashonaland, and it was not until 1897 that the rebellion was
crushed and peace for a little while came to the troubled land.
Our total casualties were 690; and of the white settlers in the
country alone 390 were killed and 150 were wounded, that is, 10
per cent. of the population. The Company spent £360,000 in
compensating the settlers for the losses the rebellion had brought
upon them.</p>

<p>It had fortunately been discovered that the rinderpest could
be stamped out by inoculation, but no sooner had this plague been
conquered by science than a terrible outbreak of red-water decimated
the remaining cattle. Locusts, too, came in unwonted numbers to
devour the crops, and horse sickness was very destructive. Then,
on the top of all Rhodesia&#8217;s troubles, came the but just concluded
Boer war cutting off this inland territory from its communications
with its commercial and military bases on the coast, retarding its
development, and once more calling on its manhood to abandon
industry and take up arms for their country. The Rhodesians responded
well to the call; twelve and a half per cent. of the population
fought in the war, and it will be in the memory of all how well they
acquitted themselves in the defence of Bechuanaland and the relief
of Mafeking. Thanks to the foresight of Cecil Rhodes, Matabeleland
was ours. Had it not been so, the Boers when defeated in
war would have trekked north into the rough country&mdash;through
which it would have been almost impossible for us to follow them&mdash;there
to form new independent states, to intrigue against us as
before. It would have been the old story over again; and after a
few years we should have been plunged into another Boer war.
But Rhodes had hemmed in the two Boer Republics. The quarrel
had to be fought out within their boundaries. There was no outlet
for them into the wilderness this time.</p>

</div>

<p>Notwithstanding these successive disasters the Chartered Company
and the settlers had done much during those few troublous
years to develop the country. The rinderpest and the native
rebellion made it all the more urgent to complete the railway
system that was to open communication with the coast. The
Company hurried on the construction. In November 1897 the
line had been extended from Mafeking to Bulawayo, and in 1899
the line from Salisbury to Beira was completed. Then the line
from Bulawayo to Salisbury was pushed on; this connection has
just been completed, and one can now travel by rail without changing
carriage from Capetown to Beira <i>viâ</i> Bulawayo and Salisbury.
Another line is being constructed through the Wankie coalfields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
which will cross the Zambesi near the Victoria Falls. How short
a time ago it seems since the man who had visited the Falls was
regarded as a great explorer! Other branches, too, will shortly open
communication to the various goldfields.</p>

<p>It is worthy of notice that Rhodesia, though the most remote
from the coast, was the one State in South Africa whose industries
were kept going during the war, so that the conclusion of peace
found her ready for an immediate expansion of her trade. This
was due to the wise policy of the Company. Early in 1900 it was
represented to the Administration that unless communication, which
had been interrupted at the commencement of the war, was soon
restored, work could not proceed on the mines; the native labourers
would have to be discharged, and the mines would have to be
closed down. The Administration realised that it would not only
be disastrous to throw so many Europeans and natives out of work,
but that the closing down of the mines would convince the Matabele
that there was truth in the report which the Boer agents were
diligently spreading to the effect that the English were being driven
out of the country, and that the opportunity for rebellion had
arrived. The Administration therefore came to the assistance of
the mining community by making arrangements for the importation
of sufficient necessaries for six months through Beira, at a fixed
transport rate of £25 per ton from Port Elizabeth. The Company
found itself about £5 a ton out of pocket by this arrangement, but
great distress was saved. At the opening of the war the price of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
grain and meal rose 100 per cent.; but the Hon. Sir Arthur
Lawley, the then Administrator of Matabeleland, warned the
Chamber of Commerce at Bulawayo that if the cost of necessaries
rose too high he would open the Government Stores&mdash;in which a
large reserve of supplies had been laid up at the outbreak of the
war&mdash;and sell to white men at a reasonable rate. This had the
desired effect for a time, but later on the merchants took an unfair
advantage of the situation, whereupon the Administrator carried out
his threat, and so brought prices sharply down again. The result
of this policy was excellent; the development of the mines proceeded,
even if slowly; the crops were sown and there was a good
harvest; the natives remained quiet and readily paid their hut-tax,
which amounted to a larger sum than had been raised in any
previous year.</p>

<p>Considering all the disasters, from the rinderpest down to the
Boer War, that have befallen the country, it is indeed wonderful
that so much has already been done towards the development of the
resources of Rhodesia. There are critics at home who maintain
that the country is valueless, that there are no payable gold reefs in
it, else the mines would by this time have been working at a profit.
People in the old days spoke in the same way of the Rand. Now,
it was not until 1897, when the railway reached Bulawayo, that the
real development of the mines commenced, and since then the
country has produced gold to the value of a million and a quarter
sterling, and this with a very limited number of stamps running.
The gold belt extends for about 500 miles. Out of the 114,000
claims that have been pegged out, only 737 have been worked at
all. Some of the mines have already paid dividends. The future
possibilities of these yet practically untouched goldfields no one can
estimate.</p>

<p>It had been naturally expected that so soon as the opening of the
Rhodesian railways lowered the cost of transport rapid progress
would be made in the working of the mines, and critics at home
express their wonder that more has not been done; but the enormous
increase in the cost of local transport due to the rinderpest has
cancelled the advantage gained by the low railway rates from the
south. Before the railway was constructed or the rinderpest appeared,
the transport from Mafeking to Bulawayo, a distance of
500 miles, was ten shillings per 100 lbs. It costs as much as that
now to transport mining machinery by ox-waggon from the Bulawayo
railway-yard to a mine only 50 miles distant; and some of the
mines are as far as 200 miles from a railway station. The branch
lines that are being constructed will bring many of the mines within
easy reach of the railway, but no great general progress can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
made throughout Rhodesia until cattle become plentiful and cheap
again. The Chartered Company is taking active steps to restock
the country. The importation of cattle on a large scale, both by
the various companies and by individuals, is now proceeding.
Cattle of an excellent breed, suitable to the climate, are being
brought from Angoniland, and will be crossed with Kerry or Jersey
bulls. Importers of stock intended for breeding purposes can carry
them over the Rhodesian railways at considerably reduced rates.
Moreover, the Administration advances money to farmers on easy
terms, on the security of their farms, to enable them to purchase
cattle. With regard to the rinderpest, inoculation has proved
successful, and the Government should be able to subdue any fresh
outbreak by using the serum which is now manufactured at
Kimberley.</p>

<p>Now that peace has come to South Africa, all that Rhodesia
wants to enable her to make rapid progress is cheap transport,
which she will shortly have, and abundant and efficient native
labour; for surely the sore trials of her youth, which she so pluckily
endured and survived, are over at last. The gold is there; the
majority of the reefs are permanent, and to quote from the report of
the Chartered Company&#8217;s Resident Consulting Engineer:&mdash;&#8220;What
the future may hold it is impossible to say, but the most grievous
pessimist must surely admit that the experimental stage has been
safely passed, and that Rhodesia has been proved to be a valuable
gold-mining country of which the possibilities are enormous.&#8221; The
recent discovery of valuable coal deposits will greatly assist the
development of the country&#8217;s resources, more especially benefiting
the gold-mining industry, for the timber is becoming exhausted in
the vicinity of the mines, and the price of wood fuel is ever advancing.
A careful examination of one small section of the Wankie bed shows
that it will yield 1000 tons a day of coal of excellent quality for the
next hundred years. It is too early yet to discuss the value of the
iron, copper, and other ores which exist in Rhodesia.</p>

<p>To turn to agriculture. There seems to be no production of the
temperate and sub-tropical zones that does not flourish on the
favoured, well-watered soil of Southern Rhodesia. The area under
cultivation is rapidly extending. The one great drawback is the
locust. However, farming pays well despite occasional bad seasons.
Here is a story that exemplifies the tenacity, under disaster, of the
Rhodesian settler. In one year, when the successive locust swarms
ate up the land, a certain farmer sowed his farm with mealies. The
locusts devoured the crop: undiscouraged, he sowed his fields a
second time: again he lost his crop. Yet a third time he sowed,
and got his harvest in safely. Despite the two failures, he now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
realised a handsome profit. Happily, in the season of 1898-99
locusts almost entirely disappeared, and apparently they have never
since invaded the country in their former numbers. It is claimed
that this is due to the extensive use of toxine, with which for the last
few years a campaign of extermination has, with apparent success,
been carried on against these scourges of the land. The toxine has
been distributed among the white farmers and the native chiefs,
with instructions for its use, and satisfaction with the results has been
generally expressed. An energetic farmer does well in Rhodesia,
and finds among the mining communities an ever-increasing market
for his produce. At present the principal products are mealies, barley,
wheat, oats, forage, and potatoes, and excellent crops are raised.
Market farming and dairy farming in the vicinity of the towns are
industries that require little capital, and are exceedingly profitable.
Boer tobacco is produced in large quantities, and experiments that
have been tried with American seed have proved the suitability of
soil and climate for the cultivation of the superior qualities of tobacco.
Oranges, peaches, walnuts, apples, bananas, figs, cherries, vines, and
other fruits do very well in Rhodesia. In the yet uncolonised north
of this vast territory wild rubber of high commercial value covers
large tracts of country. The Chartered Company is taking steps to
protect the plant against the destructive native methods of extraction,
and to make it a source of wealth to Rhodesia as well of
revenue to itself. In several districts the cultivation of coffee and
tea promises to prove successful.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></p>

<p>As elsewhere in South Africa, the chief difficulty in the way of
the development of the country is the disinclination of the idle natives
to work on the mines or elsewhere, all the more so now that so
many have been spoilt by the excessive wages paid to them by the
military authorities during the war. The native of Mashonaland,
for example, living in a country blessed with a fruitful soil and
splendid climate, protected by our rule from the raids that used to
devastate his lands, reaping his crops in security, assisted by the
Administration in hard times of rinderpest or locust scourge, is now
more than ever loth to work. He can earn as much as £3 a month
with food and lodging. But for the protection which he enjoys, and
which enables him to wax rich, he only contributes to the expenses
of Government his hut-tax of ten shillings. An increase in his hut-tax
might induce him to work for a few weeks in the year. If
nothing will overcome his deep-rooted indolence, other labour must
be imported. Arabs from Aden are already working in some of
the mines.</p>

<p>The pay of the skilled white miner is 30s. a day. Throughout
Rhodesia the artisan earns good wages, the blacksmith and the
bricklayer, for example, receiving respectively 30s. and 35s. a day
in Salisbury. Detractors of Rhodesia are constantly asserting that
the white population is outrageously taxed, each settler, they state,
having to pay £40 per annum to the Chartered Company in the
shape of taxes; and a well-known politician, beloved of Little
Englanders, has publicly declared that this is the case. It appears
that these ingenious people arrived at this conclusion by dividing
the amount of the Company&#8217;s revenue, £440,000, by the number of
Europeans in the country, namely, 12,000, which certainly does give
a result of nearly £40 per head. It is thus assumed that all the
Company&#8217;s revenue is derived from the taxation of the settlers.
Now, in the first place, out of this £440,000 of revenue, £113,000
represents the amount of the native hut-tax, and is therefore not
contributed by white people at all. Another £23,000 is derived
from the sales and rent of land, the Company&#8217;s property; and
another £58,000 from the telegraph and postal services, which up
till now have been worked at a loss. No one can maintain that
these items fall under the head of taxation. To go further, another
£86,000 of the Company&#8217;s revenue is paid directly by the mining
companies that have been floated&mdash;that is, by the shareholders in
England, not by the people of Rhodesia. These figures added up
amount to £280,000, which leaves a balance of £160,000&mdash;the taxation
laid on the settlers, that is, about £13 per head. To go still
further, of this £160,000, £73,000 is derived from the duties on
wines, spirits, and tobacco. Therefore if one puts these luxuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
out of the calculation the taxation amounts to only £7 a head per
year, which is anything but high when one bears in mind that there
are no paupers in Rhodesia, that women and children are few, and
that the large bulk of the population are adult males in the prime of
life earning high wages.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Rhodesian Mining. The Dobie Mill</span>

<p>The climate of the Rhodesian plateau is undoubtedly healthy
and well suited to British colonists. It is a land where the white
man can work in the fields. The British children reared here are
as rosy of cheek and as sturdy of limb as those at home. There is,
of course, malaria in the lowlands, but that will disappear before
occupation and civilisation, even as it has done in once unhealthy
districts of the Transvaal and the Cape Colony. It is the same
with the diseases that affect domestic animals: thus horse-sickness
once prevailed far to the south, and gradually has been driven north
before advancing civilisation. The dreaded tsetse fly too, fatal to
horses and cattle, can only exist where the larger wild beasts abound,
and vanishes with the latter wherever the white man establishes
himself. The rinderpest, in killing off the wild buffalo, did one good
service: the tsetse disappeared with the buffalo, and now only
frequents remote and unfrequented regions.</p>

<p>From every point of view the future of Rhodesia now looks
hopeful. The young State suffered from every calamity that can
befall a new country, but was too vigorous to succumb. The Company
and the Rhodesian community have displayed pluck, energy,
and patriotism in the hour of Britain&#8217;s danger, and every loyal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Englishman must sincerely wish Rhodesia prosperity. As regards
the prospects of the Chartered Company itself, I will conclude by
calling attention to one point. Up till now the Company has been
compelled to maintain a large and expensive military force, costing
£276,000 a year. Now that the Boer war has been brought to a
conclusion, the necessity for so large a force has ceased to exist, and
Mr. W. H. Milton, the Senior Administrator of Southern Rhodesia,
has recommended, as sufficient to meet the requirements of the
country, the maintenance of a force of 400 Europeans and 400
natives, with a simple organisation on the lines of the Cape Police.
The cost of this, he maintains, should not exceed £100,000 per
annum. If his proposal is accepted, the revenue of the Chartered
Company should balance its expenditure, and the corner will be
turned.</p>

<span class="small">Drawing by Chas. M. Sheldon.</span>
</div>

<p>As to the political situation to-day, it seems scarcely to be
apprehended in this country that the lines of cleavage between parties
and factions at the Cape, and indeed in the new colonies, are by no
means simple ones. In South Africa generally it is not merely a
case of Briton <i>versus</i> Boer; it is not in Cape Colony simply a case
of Dutch Africander <i>versus</i> British loyalist. In the Transvaal the
problem is not solely how to bring the Boers and English together,
or how to conciliate and retain the loyalty of those men, largely of
British origin, formerly known as Uitlanders. A labour party,
championing a programme practically identical with that with which
all students of later-day politico-social questions are familiar, is
coming into existence, and is, I think, certain to make itself a power
in the land as time advances. It has been frequently, if somewhat
hastily, assumed that in South Africa generally parties will follow
the lines of division common to most civilised communities, and
range themselves in camps, the composition of which will be
determined respectively by the place of residence and occupation of
the units of the people; the interests, sentiments, and aspirations
of the town dwellers being at variance with those of the rural in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>habitants.
In a sense, we may take the people of Johannesburg
to represent what passes for the urban population of old-settled
countries. Roughly speaking, the citizens of the older established
and smaller towns were dependent for their existence, and are likely
to continue to be so dependent, on the agriculturists, since outside
the Rand the Transvaal had no industries, no manufactures worth
considering: for some time to come she is not likely to have any.
So the Rand stood and stands for the towns, and the Uitlanders for the
townsmen. The rest of the State stood and stands for the country,
and, the agriculturists being mainly Dutch, the Boers stand for the
countrymen. In the future, however, the race question, which has
practically overruled any dividing lines drawn on the basis of
townsmen and countrymen in Cape Colony, should cease to govern,
in quite the old way, the political antagonisms of the inhabitants of
the Transvaal; in any case, if the various schemes for settling
British farmers in the land are crowned with reasonable success, it
will no longer be possible to regard the rural Transvaalers as simply
Boers, and the townsmen as simply Britishers. At present in the
Transvaal there exists, of course, the great and principal division of
its people, the British and philo-British <i>versus</i> the Dutch and philo-Dutch.
But the interests of the great mining companies are not
now, and never can be, on all-fours with those of the operatives;
while the traders are likely to find their ideals at variance with
those of the mining magnates and operatives alike. Obviously
there will be no immediate community of interest and aim between
the old Boer farmers and the new British elements introduced on to
the land. The differences of the townsmen are likely to be more
strictly economic than political; but they must necessarily take a
political complexion in the process of their devolution. It would be
rash to attempt anything in the shape of a precise forecast; but
it certainly seems to me quite unlikely that the future divisions
into parties of the citizens of the Transvaal can take the simple form
of Briton <i>versus</i> Boer. No doubt the existence of the two races,
living side by side, with the remembrance of a century&#8217;s differences
between them, will continue to give a decided tincture to the
parties to be formed in the future. It depends entirely on the kind
of statecraft Great Britain brings to bear on the settlement of the
new colonies and on its results, whether the progressive elements
in the existing population&mdash;the population waiting for the gates to
be opened to it may, for the purposes of this argument, be considered
as entirely progressive&mdash;range themselves on the side of
British imperialism, or whether they will join themselves to those
forces, already existing, which openly or secretly aim at the establishment
of a republican régime. It is quite a mistake to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
these forces&mdash;republican sympathies, that is to say&mdash;are at the
moment entirely to be sought for in the Boer camp. It is, or it
ought to be, common knowledge that the internal movement for
reform on the Rand, and for the elimination of the Dopper-Hollander
dominance of Pretoria, was not exactly inspired or sustained
by men who wished to see the Transvaal an integral portion
of the British Empire. At the same time, it is not denied that a
great many sympathisers with this movement, and not a few of its
active supporters&mdash;the late Mr. Rhodes, for instance&mdash;were above
all things anxious that when the Transvaal flag was hauled down
the Union Jack should be run up.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from such considerations, matters of history,
it may be allowed that whatever the nationality or preferences of
respective Uitlanders at that time of day, a rough sense of justice
would reconcile most of them now to the flag of the country, which
at enormous sacrifice of treasure and men has procured their release
from the bondage of Pretoria. It is equally certain, more so in fact,
that their acceptance of the British flag, now and hereafter, is and
will be contingent on the treatment they receive at the hands of
the new Government. Already many voices are heard in the land
declaring that, so far from the new Government having brought relief
to the mining industry and to the Uitlanders&mdash;and it must be
clearly understood by all Englishmen, however much they may
resent the fact, that upon the prosperity of the mines not only the
welfare of the Transvaal but of all South Africa depends&mdash;it has
increased its burdens. The limits of space will not permit any
exhaustive examination into the basis of this complaint. Mr.
Chamberlain, before these lines are in the hands of the public, will
doubtless be on the spot examining into the grounds of the complaint.
It would be clearly impossible for any one to accuse me,
of all persons, of favouring the millionaires, or of holding a brief
for their views and interests. But this is not a millionaires&#8217;, or a
mining question; it is the question of the to be or not to be of
South Africa as a British dependency. It may be said at once,
that if, as Mr. Chamberlain at one time indicated, the somewhat
contradictory and superficial report drawn up by Sir David Barbour,
full of inconsistencies and injustices as it is, is to be accepted by the
British Government, then I would not care to purchase at any price
a seven years&#8217; repairing lease&mdash;a repairing lease with a vengeance&mdash;of
British tenure of South Africa, much less the freehold of
the property. Whether he be a financial expert or not, no man
who possesses a sound working knowledge, personal knowledge,
of South Africa and its affairs can study this report and preserve
his equanimity. It fills one with fear and trembling. Sir David<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Barbour&#8217;s proposals savour of the arbitrary confiscation of mining
profits. This perhaps, standing alone, would not matter much
from a South African point of view, since the loss would mainly
fall on the hundreds of thousands of English and foreign shareholders
interested in the mines; according to the <i>Statist</i>, the British
public has something like £250,000,000 invested in the mines.
However, it is not with such losses we are at present concerned. My
contention is that if the Transvaal is taxed out of all proportion to
its wealth&mdash;its immediate or permanent prospects even; if the new
colonies, despite the heavy losses from the war, and the serious&mdash;for
a long time to come it will be serious&mdash;dearth of labour contingent
thereon, is burdened with taxation, the incidence of which
is to be double, or in any case greatly in excess of the monstrous
charges levied by Kruger and his advisers; if the Transvaal is to
be saddled with a heavy war debt, then the financial, political, and
economic ruin of South Africa in general, and the Transvaal in
particular, must follow as an inevitable consequence, and this will
happen even should a short respite be given. I have set forth
again and again, in the columns of the <i>Times</i> and <i>Post</i>, and in the
Anglo-African journal I formerly conducted, that apart from the
uneconomic and impolitic nature of these suggestions, they are
morally unsound. He who calls the tune must pay the piper. The
British people, by allowing themselves to be ruled and betrayed by
men who persisted in blinding their eyes to the writing on the
wall, though there were Daniels in abundance to interpret it to
them; by allowing themselves to be served by an army wholly
inadequate in numbers, and largely composed of inefficients, are
responsible for the cost of a war which never would have taken
place had British pro-consuls and colonists on the spot been trusted;
their counsel listened to here, and their hands freed and actions
upheld yonder.</p>

<p>Moreover, all such heroic schemes of taxation in the interest
of the British taxpayer, of which Sir David Barbour&#8217;s report is a
type, are based on proleptic statistics of an expansion which after
all is problematical, and which in any case will not become solid
fact if onerous conditions are imposed upon the Rand in advance
of that expansion. The profits from the mines, great as they
ought to be if we do not strangle the goose right away, are
ephemeral profits&mdash;thirty to fifty years will see the last of them.
Possibly the high-water mark of production will be reached twenty
years hence, and from that time the decline will begin as in the
case of the Australian and Californian mines. It is obvious, therefore,
that a heavy war debt must press disastrously on the industry
during its growth and during its decline. Taxation seems to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
been proposed on the basis of the anticipation, as if it were already
an accomplished fact, of the most prosperous days possible of
attainment by the industry, and in entire obliviousness of the fact
that no sooner is the zenith reached than gradual decline, ending in
extinction, must supervene. Unjust taxation would be a suicidal
policy; it would retard the flow of capital, render all but a few
higher-grade mines unprofitable, with the result that the budgets
of the new colonies would show deficits year after year. Not
only would capital awaiting employment be frightened into other
channels, but schemes of federation would remain sterile schemes;
and the hope of a prosperous and united South Africa would continue
a mere day-dream, impossible of accomplishment.</p>

<p>I have put this question of the taxation of the Transvaal in the
forefront of this paper, because it is of pressing importance and
immediate interest. Scarcely less important, though the subject
will probably be dealt with more fully by another pen, is the question
of land settlement. We are approaching this matter too
parochially and timidly. If the land companies and burghers will
not part with suitable land to settlers on reasonable terms, they must
be made to do so. The example of New Zealand must be followed.
It is absolutely essential that we should plant out settlers on a large
scale; especially is it essential in view of the fact that the loyalty of
the dwellers in Johannesburg and other mining centres is not to be
counted on confidently. With these men commercial considerations
are certain to be dominant. Even if they are not given the solid
reasons for discontent already foreshadowed, reasons, real and
imaginary, in plenty are certain to crop up. Hence their loyalty
will not be a matter of sentiment, but one of calculation. Further,
every help and encouragement must be given to the right kind of
settlers; the country which spent over two hundred millions sterling
in making South Africa a possible place for Englishmen to live in,
should not grudge another ten, twenty, or if necessary thirty millions
to make the conditions of life sufficiently attractive to the emigrating
English agriculturist. The conditions underlying land settlement
have been carefully studied by Mr. Arnold Forster&#8217;s Land Commission,
and they were lucidly set forth in the report of that Commission.
It remains for the Imperial Government to make them operative, by
coming to the country for generous support. I can do no more here
than record my absolute conviction, for what it may be worth, that
if land settlement in the new colonies is to find its own level, so to
speak; if we are trusting to men with the necessary capital, some
£300 or more, to come forward in anything like sufficient numbers
to affect appreciably the question of British <i>versus</i> Boer in favour of
the British, or the problem of self-seeking Cosmopolitanism (purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
commercial interests) <i>versus</i> sentimental and patriotic Imperialism,
we are building our hopes on sand. The drawbacks to farming in
Africa are many: absence of transport (and obviously without well-devised
and speedily carried out railway schemes the internal development
of South Africa is impossible); absence of navigable
rivers; recurrent droughts (here again I may say that nothing less
can avail than grand schemes of organised irrigation such as those
favoured by Mr. Hedger Wallace and by Mr. Willcocks in his luminous
report); cattle disease and locusts. The <i>ignis fatuus</i> of the
Rand, it must always be remembered, is ever present to lure away the
settler when he has once been induced to settle. To the Englishman
the love of isolation is not generally the strongly developed vice or
virtue it is with the Boer. Consequently, we must go before the
settler and prepare the way for him. Large and well-organised
schemes of planting families on communal principles, freely scattered
over the land in the midst of the Boers, both from an economic and
political point of view, are absolutely necessary if we are to retain
our hold on the country, or ensure its permanent prosperity. Under
proper conditions and safeguards, generous schemes of female immigration
must be initiated. It has been said, and I do not gainsay it,
that South Africa requires almost immediately 70,000 more women.
Also the Children of the State, the waifs and strays, the foundlings,
those who are physically and morally fit, of course, should be sent
out to South Africa, there to be carefully prepared in proper establishments
for colonial life. In this matter we may well learn wisdom
from the early Dutch settlers, who, under an arrangement with the
Amsterdam authorities, received into their midst a number of foundlings.
From these the present race of sturdy burghers has sprung.
The subject is too vast for detailed treatment here; else much might
be said about the policy of obliging all male settlers to bind themselves
to a course of military training and contingent service, and as
to the expediency of encouraging a respectable number of Canadians
and Australians to make their home in South Africa. It is, in any
case, obvious that no tentative tinkering with the question of land
settlement can avail.</p>

<p>The sooner we face this necessity the better; since the sooner it
is in a fair way to being faced, mastered, and provided for, the sooner
can those electoral and legislative concessions we have promised the
Boers, and which honour, justice, and expediency oblige us to grant
at the earliest possible date, be granted. As things now are, we have
a British autocracy in power, alternating in turn between the desire
to repress the clamant demands of the one great industry of South
Africa&mdash;the gold mines, and dread of that powerful confederacy&mdash;the
Rand magnates. The methods and example of the great financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
corporations and financial princes are not, to write temperately, conducive
to the elevation of public morals; nor do they tend to give to
the public life of a colony a high or healthy tone. Students of Mr.
Cecil Rhodes&#8217; career cannot fail to notice the disintegrating effect
on that great patriot&#8217;s manners, and on his public and private procedure,
which resulted from his close association with, and inexplicable
reliance on, men, most of whom (it would be invidious to
specialise the exceptions) lived and moved and had their being on
a plane infinitely lower than Rhodes&#8217; natural one. The destinies of
the new colonies are for the moment nominally in the hands of
British officials. These officials have practically nobody to go to
for counsel but the mining and financial experts. This is not as it
should be. The sooner there is a free play of interests and opinions
between the Boers, British settlers, and Johannesburgers the better.
These divergent classes, all colonial, however antagonistic their
interests and prejudices, must fight out their differences among themselves
as best they may. The British official, excellent as he is in
dealing with subject races, is not seen at his best in controlling men
of his own flesh and blood&mdash;men, I should say, of his own colour&mdash;when
these men are in a position of political inferiority to himself.</p>

<p>The mention of this subject reminds me, that one of the most
effective arguments in favour of granting representative institutions
to the new colonies as quickly as may be is to be found in the native
question. In this matter, as indeed in every matter, colonial
opinion asserting itself through the necessarily imperfect, but only
possible, system of parliamentary institutions, must be respected.
As to the native question, an enormous majority of British South
Africans, though it may reprobate certain tendencies to undue
harshness, brutality even, still observable in the conduct of Boers of
the baser sort, is nevertheless convinced that the Dutch attitude
toward the native is, in its essence, the only possible or safe one.
There is not the smallest fear that anything in the shape of compulsory
labour will be sanctioned by any legislature in South Africa.
But that the principles and provisions of that most statesmanlike
Act, the Glen Grey Act, will be further extended there can be no
doubt.</p>

<p>That the labour question throughout South Africa, and especially
as it affects the mining industry, is among the more difficult problems
of the future, most persons are aware. It is said that in five
years&#8217; time 320,000 natives will be required at Johannesburg to
work the mines, irrespective of enormous domestic requirements
there. To this total we must add the hundreds of thousands needed
for industrial and household work throughout South Africa. It is
estimated that in five years&#8217; time there will be no more than 600,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
working Kaffirs south of the Zambesi. It is obvious that under the
most favourable computation the supply is certain to continue to be
totally inadequate to the demand. This is the more apparent when
it is remembered, that it is only possible to get a small proportion of
able-bodied Kaffirs to work at all, and that the average service of
these willing ones is not more than four months a year, taking one
year with another. Doubtless the new laws as to capitation tax,
and the modifications in the direction of greater stringency in
the hut tax, alterations which must have the effect of reducing
the economic evil of polygamy, will effect some amelioration in the
conditions now obtaining. But the lowering of wages and the
prohibition of the liquor sale have retarded the immediate supply.
I have had to listen before now to arguments in favour of the
unrestricted sale of liquor to the natives, and in advocacy of
establishing drinking booths from one end to the other of the
Rand. This would be as suicidal, politically and socially, and in
the long run as uneconomic a policy as could well be devised, to say
nothing as to its cynical immorality. Of course, when schemes of
organisation are perfected, and labour is largely drawn from Central
Africa, the employers will enjoy some measure of relief; but in the
end, unless relief comes from that highly debatable source&mdash;the
importation of coolie labour&mdash;the prejudice against white labour in
Africa will have to break down: a way out, I am sure, always
provided the whites can be differentiated and segregated from the
blacks, which cannot but be fraught with results of lasting benefit to
the country, in procuring for it a solid substratum of Caucasian settlers
who will become the industrial backbone of the country. The indirect
advantages of such an innovation cannot be reaped, however, if
schemes of heavy taxation are to be sanctioned. The margin
between loss and profit in working most of the mines&mdash;they are
what are called in city slang &#8220;low-grade propositions&#8221;&mdash;is so small,
that a slight increase even in the price of labour would often make
mining unprofitable.</p>

<p>The employment of white labour would have the effect of
disabusing the minds of the natives of the growing conviction that
they are necessary to our well-being and existence. The truth is
not so far short of this; but we must not make it apparent: we
must try to make it less true than it is. During the war the native,
spoiled by the military, did not gain respect for the Englishman.
He is a shrewd fellow, and although our arms were victorious in the
end, he cherished no delusions. Man for man, he has seen for
himself how much more effective as a fighter the Boer was than
the Briton. Enjoying special advantages&mdash;his knowledge of the
country and his control over the Kaffirs&mdash;the Boer was enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
make the best use of his superior marksmanship, tactics, and mobility;
with the result that it was easy for him to inflict much greater
damage on his opponents than that opponent, with all his courage
and spirit, could inflict in return. The native has seen our men lying
in ghastly, mutilated masses. He has seen few such spectacles on
the Boer side. The native is no sentimentalist. He is much like
a prevalent type of modern young woman&mdash;fond of laughing, enjoyment,
gew-gaws and sweets, while viewing everything from the
standpoint of self-interest. In brief, despite his jollity he is as hard
as nails. It is perfectly right that we should show him some consideration
as the descendant of tribes who conquered the land some
century or so earlier than we conquered it; for, except so far as
being an inhabitant of the continent is concerned, it is absurd to talk
of the existing South African tribes as aborigines. But if the
&#8220;nigger&#8221; will not work, he must in the long run give place to men
who will, to British and Continental labourers and to other British
subjects&mdash;the coolies of India, for instance&mdash;men who will work, and
who are now starving, or are on the brink of starvation, for the want
of it. That this step is not to be taken lightly I am free to admit. It
is fraught with grave difficulties and dangers&mdash;political, economic,
and ethnical&mdash;considerations which are by no means to be minimised
even if for a larger good&mdash;South Africa cannot be allowed to
languish for lack of labour&mdash;they will have to be ignored.</p>

</div>

<p>There can many, indeed in most directions,
the civil administration of the new colonies, so far as it has been
provided, is highly creditable to Lord Milner and the able men
associated with him. So excellent and so thorough is the work accomplished&mdash;in
education, in replacing the machinery of the higher civil
administration throughout the colonies&mdash;that, without hyperbole, it
may be said to fill one with admiration and wonder. If one could
always be sure of getting such a man as Joseph Chamberlain at the
Colonial Office, and such a man as Alfred Milner as High Commissioner,
one would be strongly in favour of retaining permanently as
much power as possible in the hands of the holders of these two
offices. But it is not possible to count upon a succession of such
ministers. It is noteworthy, and I would especially emphasise the point
in view of what is to follow, that the appointment of Lord Milner
and Mr. Chamberlain to their respective offices may be said to have
been in defiance of precedent. Since the institution of the Colonial
Secretaryship half-a-century ago, ministers appointed to the office
have almost invariably been noblemen of little or no importance.
Again, Lord Milner&#8217;s earliest career was not official. He was quite
out of the groove in which the men who become colonial governors
usually run. It is regrettable, that the success of these two statesmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
does not give the Government heart of grace to put appointments in
the new colonies more largely into the hands of men of proved
initiative and originality&mdash;men who have not had any good which
may have been in them strangled by red tape and flummery in the
public offices. The complaint as to the appointments made in the
Transvaal&mdash;appointments of untried striplings and callow fledglings
from the universities, is doubtless exaggerated; but it is well to
remember that putting power into the hands of the &#8220;curled darlings
of the nation&#8221; was one of the chief causes, among many contributory
causes, of the failure of Sir Theophilus Shepstone&#8217;s policy; the
reason why the annexation of the Transvaal, with the tacit consent
and approval of the majority of its people, was subsequently
repudiated by them.</p>

<p>However that may be, it is extremely regrettable that a country,
possessing so many good men, men in every way indicated by their
abilities and achievements as successful administrators <i>in posse</i>, is
constantly at a deadlock for the lack of suitable public servants. I
could mention spontaneously, without having time for reflection and
for selection, a round dozen, probably a score, men of parts full of the
sense of our imperial responsibilities, and certain to be able and
zealous in the Empire&#8217;s service: men accustomed to positions in
which initiative and sound judgment are demanded of them, who,
pining to be men of action, to play their part, however humble, in
affairs of State, affairs of which they possess a firm grip, are condemned
to enforced inactivity, buried away in country houses, or, let
us say, wasting their energies in mere constructive synthesis or
destructive criticism, for which, alas! no one is much the better.
These men, the born administrators of our over-seas dominions, are
lost to the Empire, because of the red-tape exclusiveness and
jealousy of the ruling classes of this country.</p>

<p>I have been betrayed for the moment into an academic consideration,
and let me say here that I sorrowfully endorse&mdash;I might add
that in a large measure I have publicly anticipated&mdash;most of the
strictures on our system of misgovernment, corruption, and panoplied
vice set forth in the letters of that sturdy Africander signing himself
by his true initials &#8220;P. S.&#8221; Under these abuses we groan, and it
is difficult to continue to hope that we shall escape from their
tyranny, and rise again to that full manhood of our race asserted in
the spacious days of Elizabeth, and again when Napoleon threatened
our shores. Our grand old country is sinking deeper and deeper
into the morass of spiritual and intellectual indifferentism, sordid
materialism, and time-serving opportunism. One sees scant justification
for optimism, unless, indeed, Judgment should descend upon
us and beneficently scourge us back to our nobler past.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not, however, with these larger issues I am at this moment
directly concerned. Despite the constant drains upon our best and
most vital manhood the possession&mdash;protection and administration&mdash;of
the most extensive empire of this or any age impose upon the
United Kingdom, upon, that is to say, a small and no longer
rapidly increasing nation, I do not believe that there would be any
ground for the fear that we have annexed more territory than we can
effectively administer, or that we have incurred greater responsibilities
than we can sustain, if we had the presence of mind, the
initiative and sense to utilise those latent sources of unexhausted
supply we now wilfully neglect. The immediate bearing of these
remarks reveals itself when the serious problem of the <i>personnel</i> of
the magistracy of the new colonies is mentioned. Every one knows
that the landdrosts under the old régime, men for the most part
rough and unlettered, were habitually underpaid and habitually
corrupt. The inadequate salaries paid to these men are, it seems,
now being continued to the new magistracy, and this despite the
enormous increase in the cost of living, with the result that men
of quite inferior parts are mainly available for the positions; while,
when from stress of life and circumstance, men of the right stamp,
men to whom Boer and Kaffir can look up as their natural superiors,
chance to fill these offices, they are unable, by reason of their
poverty, to live in a way or to comport themselves in a manner
consistent with the dignity of their offices.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal, and indeed in South Africa generally, it behoves
us to welcome all comers from Europe and America, not being
adventurers or wastrels&mdash;all and sundry who can contribute to the
good of the country and who are willing to become loyal citizens.
It will be madness to attempt to build up a South African nation
from these islands alone. England is a small country and the
English are gradually ceasing&mdash;and this tendency is certain to increase&mdash;to
rear large families. In the past, in our own land as well
as in our realms beyond the seas, our chief glory has been in our
genius in amalgamating different strains, bringing them all into the
fold as patriotic Britons. The British Empire is now more than
ever a crucible wherein metals, precious and base, may be wrought
into a fine amalgam. Whether as a limb of a great and regenerated
British Empire, and therein my individual hopes lie, or as a powerful
republic on the pattern of the United States, there ought to be no
question as to the future of South Africa. Mr. Chamberlain said
again only the other day that the prosperity of South Africa in the
not far distant future would doubtless exceed the dreams of the
most sanguine visionary. So let it be. Many shrewd Americans
are of the same mind. No doubt the immediate expansion in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Africa&#8217;s import trade is due to military requirements, while the
shrinkage of its export trade may be attributed mainly to the war
having put a stop to the recovery and exportation of gold. The cost
of living throughout South Africa, at present extraordinarily high, is
certain to be reduced to more reasonable limits when the railways
are permanently relieved from the control of the military. It must
be remembered, too, that while a fair proportion of favoured individuals
among the colonists have reaped huge harvests by the war,
a far greater number have been crippled and ruined outright by it.
It is not for me to deal with the problems of trade; but I may say
that even should some scheme of the favoured-nation kind be extended
to British imports by the South African Realm to be, that in
itself would not serve, nor will the spirit of patriotic preference for
British goods suffice to preserve the trade of South Africa for this
country. The matter rests with our manufacturers, exporters, and
their agents; and no one, not being a self-deceived egoist, can pretend
that the more alert, adaptive, and modern methods of American
and German houses are not certain, unless our countrymen turn over
a new leaf, to prove too much for our <span class="smcap">laissez-faire</span>, self-sufficiency,
and careless indifference.</p>

<p>In this matter the best men, be they English, German, or
Yankee, will win. But this is a home rather than a South African
question. In any case, we may expect soon to see a considerable
influx of capitalists, farmers, and traders, and they cannot but give
an impetus to South Africa&#8217;s reviving fortunes, let political ineptitude
do its worst. I have endeavoured to show wherein lie the chief
obstacles to progress in the new colonies. In the old&mdash;Natal would
in any case seem to have an era of immediate prosperity before
her&mdash;the future is darkened by considerations all too apparent for
the most optimistic or blind to overlook or ignore. The Africander
Bond and the Dutch Reformed Church have not buried the hatchet.
Throughout South Africa it is, of course, the duty of the loyal South
African of British origin or British sympathies to endeavour to recognise
at their best the many sterling qualities of the Dutch, and to
forgive with what charity he may their besetting sins, condoning
them as the resultants of environment and circumstance. It is also
their duty to recognise that the past mistakes of Downing Street
were chiefly due to lack of brain and thought, rather than to lack of
heart, and to determine to work with all true patriots for the lasting
good and welfare of South Africa.</p>

<p>Unhappily there is ample evidence to show that the Dutch
Reformed Church and the Africander Bond are as active for evil as
ever. How great is the terrorism exercised by the <span class="smcap">Commissie van
Toezicht</span> (the Secret Council of the Bond) is illustrated to-day by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
abject recantation of the Rev. Mr. Botha, a pastor who, having counselled
his countrymen to submit to the inevitable and accept British
rule as far back as September 1901, now stands in the white sheet of
repentance, and abjectly craves to be forgiven for what he calls his
temporary weakness and backsliding! Undoubtedly disloyalty to
the British Empire throughout South Africa has its <i>fons et origo</i> not
in the Transvaal but at the Cape. For the moment the Bond lies
low. It has gained everything it can hope to gain for the present.
This the most superficial student of Cape politics can see. The
problem of how to reconcile divergent elements at the Cape,
and to make the Cape Dutch as loyal to the Empire as the French
Canadians to-day, not that their loyalty is unimpeachable, is an
extremely complicated one. At the Cape it is by no means merely
a question of Dutch <i>versus</i> English or of Town <i>versus</i> Country.
Many of the most active enemies of Great Britain are to be found in
the houses of the old Dutch families inhabiting the suburban districts
of Cape Town&mdash;Wynburg, Rondebosch, and so forth. It is
also true that among those old Dutch families no more loyal subjects
of the king are to be found. Unhappily English associations, close
intercourse with Government House, intermarriage with English
families, and education at our universities or at the Temple here,
do not always ensure that the Dutch Africander will be loyal to
Great Britain. Even more to be regretted is the fact that many
colonists of pure British descent, birth even, are merely nominally
loyal to the Imperial connection, if as much as that. Their loyalty
is of the opportunist kind. Because of their hatred of the Dutch propaganda,
and because they fear that the Dutch, if left to themselves,
would become &#8220;top dog,&#8221; they tolerate British institutions. We
cannot blame them over much for this attitude, when we remember
how miserably we have deserted our countrymen in the past; how
we have left them to the tender mercies of the Dutch; how we have
neglected their warnings and advice, and brought ruin and misery
upon them because of our short-sightedness and stiff-neckedness.</p>

<p>Even now the British colonist has many substantial excuses for
averring that loyalty does not pay. In view of these facts it behoves
Great Britain to admit frankly her past errors and to resolve,
if she means to retain her hold on South Africa, to order her footsteps
differently in the future. It behoves Great Britain, if she
would avoid future risks of triangular disloyalty and the grave
disasters, local and international, which might supervene on another
period of neglect and snubbing, to trust the men on the spot. It
behoves her to govern South Africa firmly, consistently, and unemotionally;
to have done with Majubanimity and all its works once
and for all; all folly, such as paltering with the language and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
education questions, whereby the sentiments and interests of loyal
British colonists are flouted and ignored. Great Britain must,
however, do everything that she can consistently do to bring the
two European races&mdash;English and Dutch&mdash;together. If she is to
do this, if England is to retain a firm grip on South Africa, we must
continue strong, let it be said rather we must renew our strength
here in the centre of the Empire. Within the next half-century it
is probable that the last ounce of gold will have been extracted from
the Transvaal&#8217;s deepest deep levels. Within half that time the
impending struggle of the world Powers to establish themselves in
unassailable positions will have taken place. Germany is forced by
an inexorable law of self-preservation to find an outlet for her
commerce and her people on the seas. Every thinking German,
from the Kaiser downwards, tells us as much frankly. We can see
it for ourselves. She must find employment, food, and raiment for
her highly prolific people, for their own land is by no means rich in
natural wealth. As to Africa, our hold on it depends entirely upon
the strength of our national grip. If our hand is growing flabby and
listless, and, alas! there are too many indications that such is the
case; if France is to gain her ends in the Mediterranean; if
sentimental views in regard to the natives are to prompt us to stand
idly by while such organisations as the so-called Ethiopian Church
of the United States working from the south, and the emissaries of
a militant Mahommedanism from the north, conspire informally to
undermine their loyalty, then our days in Africa are numbered. In
the last event, our hold on that continent in general and South
Africa in particular depends upon character, especially the character
of our ruling classes. The possibilities of this country in Africa are
magnificent; but the problems to be solved, if these possibilities are
to be realised, must appal and finally overcome all but the stoutest of
heart. The world, and South Africa with it, will fall to the nation
which breeds and sustains the best men.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="THE_FUTURE_OF_THE_MINING_INDUSTRY" id="THE_FUTURE_OF_THE_MINING_INDUSTRY"></a>THE FUTURE OF THE MINING INDUSTRY</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By F. T. NORRIS</span></p>

<p>The future prosperity of South Africa mainly depends upon
the development of her vast and indisputable gold wealth,
for, albeit she possesses other resources in undoubtedly
lavish abundance, the means for the utilisation of these
latter are dependent, in a large measure, upon the effective
exploitation of her auriferous reserves. This fact was explicitly
stated by Sir David Barbour, the financial expert appointed by the
Imperial Government to report in 1901 on the resources of the
Transvaal, and that this impartial official opinion is echoed by all
competent observers prior to and since his investigations only confirms
its correctness. As to the magnitude to which the mining
industries in the Transvaal may ultimately attain opinions differ,
but, says this authority, and this view is confirmed by experts, it is
certain that the production of gold will continue to increase largely
for some years at least; that there will be a corresponding growth
in the production of coal, and it is possible, and perhaps probable,
that valuable mines of other minerals, and especially of diamonds,
may be opened. He therefore opines that, from an economic point
of view, the prospects of the future for a considerable period are
quite satisfactory, and it is unnecessary to speculate as to what may
ultimately happen.</p>

<p>Public opinion on the Rand is unanimous that absolutely vital
questions for the mines&#8217; future are, for the moment, labour and
taxation. A comprehensive and impartial view of the circumstances
of the mines must force the conclusion that such contentions are
perfectly sound. Naturally, however, the dimensions of the latter
factor have less weight since the reduction of the customs tariff
and the previous abolition of monopolies, and, with the pending
solution of the question of dynamite, the mining industry is now
not only in a vastly superior economic condition than it ever was,
but has been placed in a position to sustain, not without some difficulty
maybe at the outset, all the prospective burdens of projected
Imperial taxation. In saying &#8220;not without difficulty,&#8221; the crux of
the present economic situation, as looked at by the leading and
responsible section of the mining industry and competent individuals
at large, is touched. For the judiciousness or otherwise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
immediately heavy incidence of the share of the cost of the war,
which it may be contemplated to place on the Transvaal, is what
causes the present misgivings; and, with the operative capacity
of 1898 still some ten to fifteen months ahead, the immediate
call for heavy contributions can only act as a drag upon progress.
It is with this consideration in view that the Chamber of Mines,
in a recent letter to Lord Milner, asked for a delay of five years
before making a first payment, in order to allow time for the industry
to recover its former level, and that other authorities have also
entered their protests.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Prospecting for Gold: Panning a Sample</span>
</div>

<p>The inference that an immediate and heavy increase of taxation
is to be made to meet the war debt obligations may possibly be
gratuitous, and probabilities confirm this supposition, for it is at
issue with the Government expert&#8217;s special recommendations.
From this point of view, Sir David Barbour&#8217;s observations are
worth reciting for their direct bearing. He says: &#8220;The sound
policy for the Transvaal is to so frame its system of taxation as
not to increase unnecessarily the initial capital expenditure, or
enhance the cost of working. I shall take it for granted that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
is not intended to impose excessive or crushing taxation on either
of the Colonies, or to exact such a share of their revenue as
would cripple or starve the Administration. Subject to these
considerations, I shall assume that any surplus of revenue over
expenditure, or any special assets that the Colonies may possess,
can fairly be taken towards meeting a portion of the cost of the
war.&#8221; Further: &#8220;If the additional taxation which I recommend
... be imposed ... it may be anticipated that after two years
from the conclusion of peace that Colony will be in a position to
set aside a portion of its ordinary revenue towards meeting the
cost of the war. I am unable at present to form an estimate of
the amount which it may be possible to set aside in this way....
On the assumption that the contribution of the Orange River
Colony and the Transvaal towards the cost of the war is to be
limited to the amount which they can pay without imposing excessive
taxation or starving the Administration, it will be obvious
from what is said in the preceding portion of this report, and
especially in paragraph 62, that it is impossible at the present
time to specify any definite sum as that which ought to be paid. I
suggest that the Imperial Government should fix the maximum
sum which, under any circumstances, they would require to be paid.
Such portions of the total amount of contribution, so fixed as it
may be found from time to time that the Colonies can bear, should
be made a charge against them. If, in the course of time, it is
found that the Colonies are unable to pay the whole sum, under
the conditions as to taxation and cost of administration which I
have already specified, the balance should be written off.&#8221; So far
as the immediate incidence of war taxation is concerned, it is
therefore highly probable that the Government, who have adopted
their financial expert&#8217;s views almost <i>in toto</i> with regard to fiscal
reform, will do the same with regard to the levy of the war
contribution.</p>

<br />

</div>

<p>But another phase of the same subject is revealed in the extent
of the contribution which the Transvaal should be called to bear
compared with that of the other South African Colonies. In the
thoughts of some, tinctured still perhaps with a touch of the recent
bitterness of the war, the Transvaal should bear the heaviest share;
but it is to be observed that this is not the opinion of the responsible
heads of the mining industry, who, while admitting the justness of
assuming their proper proportion of the proposed burdens, appropriately
point out that both the Orange River Colony and the Cape
Colony (for a part of the latter&#8217;s population) were fellow-sharers in
the beginnings and the conduct of the war, and should bear a due
portion of the resultant financial burdens, while Natal, it is contended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
cannot fairly be allowed to escape contribution to the extent at least
of the valuable Transvaal territory which has been allotted to her.
Pending formal announcements of the Government&#8217;s intentions&mdash;and
it is to be observed a contribution from the Orange River Colony
is contemplated in Sir David Barbour&#8217;s report&mdash;many huge lump
sums have been mentioned, which it is proposed to levy on the
Transvaal alone. Such reports naturally have not only alarmed
the mining industry, but disturbed the confidence of international
capitalists, upon whom the future development of the wealth of the
goldfields in the first place rests. The extent of the alarm which is
felt is shown by the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines as a body
pleading in their recent communication to Lord Milner for a &#8220;reasonable
sum&#8221; to be fixed, and by the rough estimates of this sum propounded
by others, as, for instance, Mr. Freeman Cohen, chairman
of the Potchefstroom Exploration and Gold Mining Company, who
indicates £30,000,000 as the specific figure, while Mr. Bleloch adventures
the sum of £35,000,000. This last gentleman&#8217;s summing up
of the situation is that the mines can pay, and are willing and forward
to pay, provided the incidence at the first be made light, and that the
burden of the £55,000,000 estimate of the Government&#8217;s financial
expert be shared by the other Colonies in the proportion, say, of
£5,000,000 from each, to lessen the burden on the mining industry
as much as possible, especially the low-grade section, and also as a
matter of equity, and he advocates in addition&mdash;to augment the
disposable revenue&mdash;the levy of a 5 per cent. tax on the profits of
other industries (banks, &amp;c.), the creation of death dues and of a land
tax; also the beneficial reservation to the Government of portions
of each new mining field to be opened.</p>

<p>That the whole weight of the taxation of the Transvaal should
not be made to fall upon one industry is, of course, consonant with
reason, policy, and equity. Pending the pronouncement of its actual
intentions, and in view of the alarmist rumours which are spread
about, it behoves the Government, to allay the very natural apprehensions
entertained, to give an early and explicit outline of its
proposals, and in this connection the projected visit of the Right
Hon. J. Chamberlain to the Colonies is of the best augury. From
his place in Parliament that statesman has already disclaimed, on
several occasions, proposals anent the immediate imposition of heavy
taxes attributed to the Imperial Government, and the probabilities
are that those recently published in London are as baseless as they
are vague.</p>

<p>The dependence, to a large extent, of the development of the
mining industry on the fostering and assistance, or otherwise, accorded
by the existing Government is a point too painfully brought home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to the Rand mining industry by past experience to need demonstration;
wherefore the sound common-sense statesmanship of those now
responsible for the prosperity of the Empire is a valuable guarantee
that the various problems now absorbing the attention of the industry
will be treated in a fair, just, and liberal manner.</p>

<p>The Rand mining industry, at the moment, is undoubtedly in
the throes of one of those periodic waves of depression incident to
all great gold-mining fields, though to the Rand in a less degree than
to the others, on account of the certain results which may be reckoned
upon from the stable nature of its geological formation. Capital
required for its development is in many cases being withheld,
investors looking askance at its demands with obvious misgivings.
This attitude is undoubtedly due to impatience, and disappointment
that progress has not been more rapid since peace has been declared.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 513px;"><a name="illustration_24" id="illustration_24"></a>

<span class="caption smcap">The Infancy of a Gold-Mine: Winding Quartz with a Whim</span>
</div>

<p>Apparently it was assumed that only a cessation of hostilities
was needed for the mines to hurry up and resume their old-time
rate of production and prosperity. Such an assumption ignores
the real difficulties of reconstituting a country and its industries,
devastated and disorganised for three years by war, and setting up
an entirely new order of things. As a matter of fact, the progress
actually achieved has been marvellous, and as much, or even more,
than could have been expected in like cases. It has apparently
been forgotten that civil government has only within a few weeks
replaced the military in the main administrative channels. The
railway network of the sub-continent has only been thrown open to
the free transport of merchants&#8217; goods within the past month, and
the limitation of transit to the Rand, and the interior generally, is a
most serious matter, by reason of the fact that the trunk railways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
from the coast are only single lines. For the clearance at the
ports of the accumulations of mining machinery, mining stores,
building materials, foodstuffs, and general merchandise, months are
required, and this clearance must take place ere the railway traffic
can fall back into its normal grooves. Abundance of labour, too&mdash;always
a crucial question with mining operations, whether they be
on the Rand, in Rhodesia, or elsewhere in the sub-continent&mdash;is, for
a variety of causes, not yet available, although measures have been
taken by the Government and the mining industry, acting in concert,
which have placed this subject on a more satisfactory footing than it
ever enjoyed. Other advances have been made in the improvement
of the status of the industry, such, for instance, as the reduction
of the customs duties, which enormously improve the industry&#8217;s
chances of future remunerative working. Some desiderata are
certainly unfulfilled, such as reduced railway rates; but the instalment
of reforms made affords a fair basis on which working can be
resumed with admirable chances of remuneration and profit. This
being so, the unreasonableness of the show of impatience that progress
has not been more rapid, and the undeservedness of the distrust
with which the industry is professed to be regarded in some quarters,
are obvious. A sober view of the situation of the Transvaal at
the present moment must undoubtedly force the confession that the
amount of solid work done in solving the many problems simultaneously
surging up for solution in a new colony besides mining,&mdash;repatriation,
resettlement, &amp;c.&mdash;and in rebuilding generally the body
politic, is of substantial volume, and that the progress hitherto made,
in removing the difficulties which beset the mining industry, are
sufficient augury that whatever remains unalleviated will receive its
due and satisfactory attention in the near future.</p>

<p>In an old (1876) edition of &#8220;Chambers&#8217;s Encyclopædia,&#8221; under
the heading of &#8220;Africa&mdash;Productions,&#8221; is the statement that &#8220;It
would be hazardous to assert that Africa is deficient in <i>mineral
wealth</i>, though, judging from our present imperfect knowledge, it
does not seem to be extremely rich.&#8221; Little did the compilers of this
well-known work think that, in the space of less than twenty-five years,
a town of about 150,000 inhabitants would spring up as the centre
of a mining country which now takes rank as the first gold-producer
in the world. The gold production of the Rand to date is indeed
stated to equal one-ninth of the coined gold in circulation throughout
the world, while its potential reserves are probably fourfold this
amount. In 1887 the United States occupied first rank among
gold-producing countries, Australia being second, and Russia third,
the total gold production of the world being only £18,000,000. In
1898, South Africa occupied the premier position with 28 per cent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the aggregate world&#8217;s production, and her contribution, moreover,
represented only 3&frac12; millions less than the world&#8217;s aggregate in the
first-named year. In 1899, owing to the war, it just managed to
fall short of the headship. Since its start, the Rand gold-fields have
produced gold to the handsome aggregate amount of £81,000,000
sterling. On the fortunes of South Africa, the influence exerted by
this stupendous accretion to its wealth is past question, for the output
of £20,000,000 of gold in 1898 formed 80 per cent. of the subcontinent&#8217;s
aggregate exports in that year, while 68 per cent. of it
was disbursed in labour, foodstuffs, mining stores, and material in
the course of its winning. It is only needful to glance back at the
modest proportions of South Africa&#8217;s trade movement before the
discovery, first of diamonds and then of gold, to recognise how much
it owes to its mineral wealth, and more particularly to that of gold,
for its present-day prosperity. Its populations, its cities and ports,
its railway network, its multifarious industries from agriculture upwards,
and its merchant firms and commercial activity have each
and all been stimulated and enlarged enormously by it. As in the
case of Australia and other older gold-producing countries, the output
of gold, primarily from the Witwatersrand fields, has acted like a
perennial stream, fructifying and rendering teemful the arid wastes,
and making the very wilderness to blossom as the rose.</p>

<p>The gold-bearing quartz-pebble conglomerate beds, called by the
Boers &#8220;banket&#8221;&mdash;the discovery of gold in the outcrops of which in
1883 started the Witwatersrand mining industry&mdash;form a series of
strata going down at an angle of about 30 degrees to hitherto
unknown depths&mdash;over 8000 feet have already been plumbed&mdash;and
extending over a tested lateral distance of more than 50 miles.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>These beds lie in series, that particular one which contains most
of the gold being called the Main Reef series, comprising the Main
Reef proper and a number of subordinate reefs or bands. The
thickness of the Main Reef is from 3 to 12 feet, that of the Main
Reef Leader 3 feet on the average, and the South Reef thinner
than the latter, but having a richer gold contents than either.
These are the beds chiefly worked, the gold being disseminated
throughout the matrix mainly in crystals, visible gold being only
occasionally seen, but in fairly regular quantities, so that the results
of working, whether in the richer or poorer reefs, are capable of
being accurately forecasted. The knowledge of the nature and extent
of the beds has only gradually been brought together, and is still
incomplete in parts even for the 15 miles section of the Rand which
has been longest under working, and discoveries are of almost daily
occurrence extending the sum of information regarding their composition
and incidence. In the section situated between the Langlaagte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Estate Mine in the west and the New Comet in the east, one profitable
mine after another follows almost without a break. The eastern
and western extensions are, for the main part, still <i>terra incognita</i>;
but the several mines scattered along their stretch have confirmed
the identity and value of the formation, which is held by experts to
warrant the belief in the existence of wealth even exceeding the
Rand proper.</p>

<p>Knowledge as to the depth to which the reefs descend has been
slowest in accumulating. When the outcrops were first worked in the
central section, it was believed that there was little or no gold in the
lower levels. Since 1898, however, deep and yet deeper depths
have been explored, especially in following the richer reefs, and
always with the similar result of meeting with the same, or a superior,
grade of ore contents peculiar to the higher sections of the particular
reef, so that the inference is strengthened to certainty that
profitable exploitation is only limited to the ultimate depth at which
modern mining can be carried on. The problem, therefore, is one
for the engineers; for, apart from the increased temperature in the
lower levels, which can be met by roomier shafts, and the occurrence
of water, which is likewise capable of being dealt with, the
only difficulty to be met with is that concerned with the hoisting
appliances for such enormous depths. So recently as May last the
London Chamber of Mines, and more recently the Johannesburg
Association of Mining Engineers, were engaged on the solution of
this question. It is needless to anticipate the results of their
deliberations, the point turning upon the choice betwixt two systems,
only so far as to state that means for solving the difficulties of the
task are considered to be available, at least, to such depths as
5565 feet on the slope, and that the results of mining at these great
depths can be made to show a substantial profit. It may be added,
however, that in consequence of the increased cost to reach the
ore, the need for the utmost reduction of working costs becomes
paramount.</p>

<p>The circumstances of gold-mining on the Rand have, therefore,
features quite distinct from those of quartz-reef, alluvial, or other
kinds of mining, and approximate to those of coal winning, especially
in the matter of the depth and regularity of the conglomerate formation.
Its peculiarities have created a method of mining, the outcome
of costly experiment, experience, and skill, which will remain a
lasting asset to future ages.</p>

<p>The future gold production of the Rand mining industry is a
subject which enchains the attention alike of the investor and the
curious. In approaching the subject of the unexploited gold contents
of the banket formation, figures are handled which simulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the fabulous, and almost excuse the disbelief with which all such
estimates are received in some quarters. Confirmation of the
approximate correctness of the computations may, however, be
obtained in two ways: firstly, from the past yield of the gold-fields
in the seventeen years since their start; and secondly, from the
verification of former prognostications which subsequent outputs have
furnished. So far as regards the former, the fact of the production
of £81,000,000 of gold since the start of the industry up to now,
under well-known circumstances is, in the first place, proof positive
that the gold exists; and, in the second, affords inferential grounds
for assuming that, given at all similar circumstances, mining operations
will yield like results. This is, of course, taking the lowest
ground, for it is indubitable that the circumstances will not be alike,
but vastly improved, in which case the value of the results will be
proportionately enhanced. As to the confirmation which results from
the verification which later outputs have furnished, both of the trustworthiness
of the bases on which former forecasts were made and of
the prognostications themselves, there may be instanced the forecasts
of such early computators as Mr. Hamilton Smith, Mr. C. D. Rudd,
and others. The former, in 1892, in a report on the future production
of the Rand fields, made by request of Messrs. Rothschild,
adventured an opinion which is worth quoting textually. He said:
&#8220;With the active and energetic men who have this industry in hand,
and always supposing that the foregoing theories be correct, in <i>three
or four years from now</i> the producing power of the mines and their
reducing works will, I think, be increased to an output of <i>five
or six million tons of ore per annum</i>, worth a gross yield of over
£10,000,000. At this rate the available supply of ore, as conjectured
above, will last for more than thirty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>As an actual fact, in four years from the time of his writing the
above, the Rand gold yield from 69 companies working amounted
to 5,325,355 ozs., the total production being of the gross value of
£10,583,616; so that, far from his estimate being too sanguine or
exaggerated, it was a literal forecast of the actuality. He subsequently
expressed the opinion that the full producing power of the
Rand would be reached by the end of the century, when the output
might be expected to exceed £12,500,000 per annum. As a matter
of fact the total value of gold produced in the Transvaal in 1898
was over £15,000,000, most of which came from the Rand,
and, had mining operations in 1899 not been interrupted by
the war, the output in that year would have reached to over
£18,000,000. Mr. Smith based his estimate on a working depth
of 5200 feet, and on an area of the reef only 11 miles in extent,
but since his time deep mining has been successfully prosecuted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
7000 feet. Inference and analogy, therefore, both afford strong
support to the correctness of estimates, based on the results of past
working, of the future gold contents of the Witwatersrand reefs,
which estimates, as appears, are more likely to be under-reckoned
than otherwise, from the sheer immensity of the subject, and from
the necessarily imperfect knowledge of the potentialities of so huge
a problem.</p>

<p>The divergencies in the several estimates made from time to
time in the past of the total gold available from the Rand banket
beds have in part arisen from the sheer inability of those making
the estimates to anticipate the striking developments which have
successively been made. So far back as 1893, 325 millions, and
subsequently 450 millions and 700 millions, have been adventured
by various persons. The relative moderateness of these estimates,
compared with more recent ones, is due, as in the case of that of
Mr. Hamilton Smith, to the under-valuation of the potentialities of
deep-level mining, which are only now becoming fully apparent.
One of the more recent estimates&mdash;that of Mr. Bleloch&mdash;based on
working depths of 3000 to 7000 feet, and taken over an area of
fifty miles, embracing the district between Randfontein and Holfontein,
computes an available gold yield of £2,871,000,000 sterling,
or eight times as much as the estimate of 1893.</p>

<p>Although so enlarged, the total actually understates potentialities
by being exclusive of possible discoveries beyond these limits, and
also by the estimates being framed on the older ratios of gold recovery
to ore tonnage, thus ignoring the application of the latest
scientific methods to the treatment of the poorest ore, which would
tend to enhance the results considerably. Apart from these limitations,
this estimate of 2871 millions is made in the most systematic
manner, from careful calculations, area by area, according to the
thickness of the reefs, the tonnage per claim, and the value per ton
as they have been shown from past working. The total tonnage of
payable ore available is estimated at 1,378,000,000. The average gold
value per ton of ore in the figures works out at 41s. 7d., but in the
actuality this varies from 78s. in the richest mines down to actual
loss in the least paying of low-grade ores. In these stupendous
figures are included the contributions of the great deep-level mines,
the growing proportions of whose contributions to the aggregate
output is already becoming a noteworthy feature, while the extent
of their development cannot be foreseen. Mining engineers are
indeed already considering the specifications of equipments for
negotiating depths deeper than 7000 feet, and even in 1899 the
possibility of mining at 12,000 feet was considered. Certainly
the mining of minerals in other parts of the world has shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the feasibility of operations at much greater depths than those
mentioned.</p>

<p>The ascertainment of the proximate gold contents of the
Transvaal mining area leads up to the question, How and when
is this stupendous wealth to be rendered available? In other
words, what is likely to be the gold production in the several years
from now on, and how long will this rate of production continue?
or what are the chances of the early exhaustion of the mining
industry? To take the last item first, it is the growing conviction
of Rand mining engineers that the amount of available gold is only
limited by the extent to which mining operations can be prosecuted
below the surface. Mining engineers had up till recently generally
agreed to fix a depth of 8000 feet as the utmost limit to which
mechanical appliances and other circumstances will allow them to
follow the descent of the reefs, and the available gold yield is
calculated on this basis. But there is no finality in this statement
of depth, and already, as we have remarked, engineers are calculating
for deeper delvings, and 9000 and even 12,000 feet have
been spoken of. This latter increase of 4000 feet&mdash;from 8000 to
12,000 feet&mdash;would alone augment the gold estimate by 50 per cent.
For the rest, and retaining the 8000 feet limit estimate as the
measure of the exhaustion of the present Rand, this is naturally
controlled by the rate of production per year, which itself is dependent
on the particular circumstances of the industry during the
period in question.</p>

<p>The yearly production of gold from now onwards offers no
insurmountable obstacle to a fairly exact appreciation. It is merely
a rule of three calculation: if in the past, under given circumstances,
working results have been as follows; in the future, with the same
or like circumstances, the results will be such. Various computations
from time to time have been made on these bases, among the
most recent being those of Mr. Cooper-Key and Dr. Hatch in
1899, Mr. Goldring and Mr. Bleloch in 1901, and quite recently
Messrs. Leggett and Hatch (on 47 miles of the Rand only, and
working to depths of 4000 to 7000 feet). Mr. Cooper-Key&#8217;s forecast,
which was made in 1899, was for the output of the three
following years, the war not having then been anticipated. The
basis of his calculation, like that of Mr. Goldring&#8217;s, was the
number of stamps or the milling power employed. If in 1898, he
argued, there were in work on the Central, Eastern, Far Eastern,
and Western sections of the Rand 6000 stamps, at the end of 1899
this number would probably be increased by 165, or to a total of
6165; at the end of 1900 the increase made would be 1730 and the
total 7895; at the end of 1901 the total would have risen to 9845;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
and at the end of 1902 to 11,785. On the basis of 1800 tons milled
per stamp, of an average value of £2 per ton, and with an
average number of stamps of 7000, 9000, and 10,500 in the three
years, the output would have been: 1900, £25,200,000; 1901,
£32,400,000; and 1902, £37,800,000. Mr. Goldring, who is the
Secretary of the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines, likewise framing
his calculation on certain yearly increases in the milling power,
calculated that in the five years following the full resumption of
mining operations, 17,000 stamps would be at work, or an increase
of 11,000 on the number before the war. Allowing for a fall in the
grade of ore milled, in consequence of cheaper methods permitting
of a lower grade of ore to be dealt with, the 17,000 stamps, he
considered, would produce at least £50,000,000 sterling a year.
Writing before the war, and basing his estimate on observations
made by Mr. Eckstein that in five years the number of stamps in
working would be 12,000, Dr. Hatch, likewise following the milling
power basis, calculated for a yearly gold production of £36,000,000.
Mr. Bleloch&#8217;s opinion, taking the production in the nine working
months of 1899 of £20,000,000 as a basis, is that the rate of production
would probably double itself after the war. &#8220;If this be so,&#8221;
he adds, &#8220;in fifty years&#8217; time the product of the Rand will have
reached over £2,000,000,000, and if such an accelerated progress is
made, the whole of the vast amount now estimated may be dug out
of the Rand within sixty or seventy years.&#8221; The latest estimate
published, that of Messrs. Leggett and Hatch, going on the basis
of the average increase of production of £4,000,000 per year in the
three years before the war, and that the production in 1899&mdash;a
broken year owing to the war&mdash;was £19,000,000, concludes that,
allowing eighteen months from January 1, 1902, for the industry to
be restored to the conditions existing in August 1899, a similar
increase of production will bring the output to at least £30,000,000
per annum by June 30, 1906, and if this rate of production were to
be maintained from then on, the total production of £1,233,560,700
would give a life from January 1, 1902, of forty-two years and a
half. But as the production will decline gradually, instead of
coming to a sudden stop, the life of the industry is likely to be
prolonged for some considerable number of years beyond the period
indicated. If, on the other hand, the annual output should exceed
£30,000,000 for any considerable period, as is, perhaps, within the
bounds of possibility, this would partially offset the extension of life
due to the gradual decline of production. It is to be added, in
explanation of Messrs. Leggett and Hatch&#8217;s estimate, that it
contemplates working along a strike of forty-seven miles only, and
to the restricted depth of from 4000 to 6000 feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The following tabulated comparison of these several estimates
will assist their comprehension, it being explained that Mr. Bleloch&#8217;s
estimate is reduced to the extent of 25 per cent. as a set-off for
probably barren sections, &amp;c.:&mdash;</p>

<p>These several estimates are of course to be looked upon merely
as approximations, and they are, moreover, not framed on exactly
the same bases. They, however, agree in the main that the 1899
output of roundly £20,000,000 will be increased to some point
between £30,000,000 and £50,000,000 within a few years&#8217; time, and
maintained thereat, more or less continuously, for periods varying
over 45 and 65 years. The production of the several estimates
for the whole period gives an average of £37,000,000, which is only
slightly higher than that of Mr. Bleloch, which is £35,714,285. This,
consequently, is the handsome yearly output which the Rand mining
industry offers in the near future&mdash;an amount which alone equals the
total production of the whole world in 1897&mdash;if the circumstances are
at least equal to those which previously prevailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Having advanced the question of the future of the mining industry
to the extent of showing a possible gold yield of at least 2,871 millions,
spread over a period of seventy years at the rate of between 37 and
40 millions a year, at a moderate estimate, it is pertinent to inquire
somewhat into the efficacy of the means for securing this return, the
location of anything and its appropriation being two distinct matters.
As implied previously, the realisation of this huge prospective gold
yield depends upon the circumstances of the industry being at least
equal to those of the past. If found to be superior, the ultimate
realisation will only be made the more certain. These circumstances
may be conveniently classified as external and internal. So far back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
as the Industrial Commission of 1897 it was recognised that the
essentials for the development of the Rand were reduction of taxes
and economy in working. The evidence of all the prominent heads
of mining groups, both English and foreign, then tendered, in the
sum amounted to this. Where the circumstances of a mine are such
that they can only be worked at a higher cost than their returns, or
with only an infinitesimal profit, either costs must be reduced or the
mine compelled to close down. In many cases a reduction of working
costs of so moderate an amount as 2s. per ton means the life of
a mine, and less than this spells bankruptcy. Where mines had
exhausted every effort to reduce working costs, it was also contended
with justice that they had established a claim for moral and material
assistance on the part of the Government, where it could be properly
accorded; indeed, a personal interest, so to say, attached
to Government interference, in that the national revenues were
jeopardised when mines failed of successful working. The assistances
asked for by the mining industry, and which the Government
were able to accord, are now notorious, but are worth reciting for
the bearing they have on our present subject. They were fiscal
reforms conducing to cheapening of labour by reducing the cost
of living both for whites and natives; increase in the effectiveness
of native labour by the proper enforcement of the Liquor Law, the
cancellation of the local spirit monopoly, and the withdrawal of the
right of free imports of spirits from Mozambique and the Orange
Free State; abolition of monopolies which tended to enhance the
cost of materials used in the mines, including those of dynamite,
cement, &amp;c.; reduction of rail rates, and abrogation, by arrangement,
of the transit dues levied by the coast Colonies, thus lessening
first and working costs of mining equipments and materials;
promotion of large public works directly or indirectly affecting the
mines, such as provision of adequate water supplies, construction of
railways, &amp;c.; finally, an equitable and sympathetic attitude of the
Governing Power to all and every question having relation to the
country&#8217;s staple industry. So far as these reforms were appraisable,
they were reckoned to be equivalent to a saving of not less than
6s. per ton in working costs. What practical chance there was of
gaining the relief sought under the old <i>régime</i> is shown by the futile
results of the Industrial Commission&#8217;s labours.</p>

<span class="small">In some places the holes for blasting are bored by Kaffirs, but as a rule the drives are made with the use of boring machines driven by
compressed air. There are few accidents underground, as the rock is so hard that there is little fear of the &#8220;levels&#8221; falling in. The chief
danger is from the gas after blasting ...</span>
</div>

<p>But the altered circumstances of the mining industry since the
war are evidenced by the reforms already consummated and under
weigh, comprising among them some of the leading demands of 1897.
This fact is conclusive that, so far as external circumstances are
concerned, the mining industry is not only in the enjoyment of
equally favourable circumstances with those existing previously, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
even greatly superior. By so much, therefore, is the perspective of
the gold yield to which we have made allusion assisted towards
becoming a reality.</p>

<p>As regards the internal circumstances on which the progress
of the mining industry depends, these are the employment of the
most improved methods and means of production. They comprise
the most perfected machinery and appliances, and the latest processes
of metallurgical and chemical science. Speaking generally,
it may be said that on the Rand at the present time are employed
the most up-to-date skill and technical knowledge, and the latest
devised mechanical appliances. This, by the way, is only true
of individual mines however. The equipment of the mass varies
greatly, and necessarily so, since the conditions of one mine differ
vastly from those of its neighbour; and distant and even contiguous
localities require unlike treatment, according to the nature of the
ore or reef worked and other local conditions. The improvement
effected hitherto is evidence, however, of the initiation and energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
which have been displayed by the heads of the mining industry in
the past, and an earnest for the future, while the progress achieved
abides as an invaluable guide for all future mining operations in like
geological formations.</p>

<p>The knowledge of how best to treat the peculiarities of the
banket reef has, however, only been slowly gained, and at the cost
of much money and many unavoidable blunders. For instance, the
only metallurgical operation for the extraction of gold employed up
to 1889 was the stamping mill, and fine gold and amalgam were
necessarily abundant in the tailings which were cast away on the
spoil heap. The cyanide process, and that of the treatment of
slimes, were only applied in 1891 and 1898 respectively. Their use
has added millions to the yearly output of gold. The amalgamation
process, the chlorination treatment of concentrates, and the use
of frue vanners are other innovations gradually introduced as results
of experiment and experience, and which have likewise increased
the efficacy of the extractive operations. Similar progress has been
shown in the improvement effected in the mechanical equipment.
At first the mining operations were confined to the primitive digging
of a huge trench over the site of the outcrop, with the simplest
delver&#8217;s tools furnished by the locality. This method has advanced
to the stage of sinking shafts to the enormous depth of a mile into
the bowels of the earth, equipped with the most elaborate hoisting
plant, with underground equipment lit and worked by electricity,
and the complementary surface establishments, at a cost running into
hundreds of thousands of pounds. There yet lies before the industry
the general adoption, not only of these but of other improvements
which experience has shown to be desirable, such as the
practice of sorting of ore, the use of heavier batteries on the score
of greater economy, &amp;c., and their utilisation is merely a question
of time. As, therefore, all these improvements and betterments
have been successively made, and the mining industry is only now
gradually&mdash;it is not yet, so far as a large number of them are concerned&mdash;entering
into the full use of them, it is obvious that future
mining operations must not only enjoy the same favouring circumstances
as those which enabled the huge mining output of the
past, but a very much better environment, through the more general
use of all those methods which experience and science have shown
to be advisable. As a consequence, and in the measure of the
value of these improvements, will the effective output be ameliorated
from now onwards.</p>

<p>The value of the improved circumstances of the mining industry
alluded to is convertible into figures in the terms of working costs
and divisible dividends. The former may be said to be the baro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>meter
of the latter. In the past, in the early days of the mining
industry, when the problems of mine equipment and gold extraction
and winning were only imperfectly understood, the wasteful expenditure
of money on inefficient methods and appliances swallowed up in
many cases every vestige of profit.</p>

<p>It was incidental to the first operations on the then unknown
geological formation of the Rand, when the very science of the goldfields
had to be created. Costs of working on the Rand are now,
through the excellent system devised by the Chamber of Mines,
tabulated so that the outlay of individual mines, or of the mining
industry in the aggregate, may be seen at any moment at a glance.
For instance, taking the record for the eight years from 1890 to
1898 inclusive, for example, the working costs ranged from 80.8
per cent. of the total value of the gold produced by eighty-five
companies in 1890 down to 68.1 per cent. in 1898, the last full year
before the war, the decrease showing the extent of the progress
made in reducing the working costs. Simultaneously the dividends
increased from 19.2 to 31.9 per cent., testifying to the close kinship
with the costs factor. These figures are a general average taken
over the aggregate of the mines working, and do not represent the
ratios of working costs of individual mines, which differ of course
according to the greater richness of the ore, the fewer difficulties to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
be dealt with in winning it, and the methods employed to secure the
end in view. This is exemplified by the fact that in a few of the
best equipped mines costs have been brought down to as low as
17s. 6d. per ton, while on others they rise to 79s. 6d. and above.
The Robinson mine is a case where, despite adverse circumstances,
the enlightened employment of the latest appliances of science and
mechanics has resulted in reducing costs to an extremely low level.
In 1888 the working costs of the mine were 72s. 1d. per ton; in
1892 they were reduced to 46s. 5d., and in 1896 to 30s. 11d. They
have subsequently been reduced to a still lower figure, and this
despite the fact that the ore changed from an oxidised character to
a pyritic, involving greater difficulty and cost to treat. This mine
was the first to introduce frue vanners, the cyanide process and the
treatment of slimes, expending as much as £80,000 in the last
innovation. By means of these it raised its gold extraction from
65 to 90 per cent., and gave encouragement and impetus to all
mining on these fields. The latest costs published for the month of
September this year of thirty-six mines in working give an average
of 26s. 3d. per ton, which shows that operating charges are now at
about the same ratio as they were before the war. Although so
reduced, however, they are still relatively higher than they may be
expected to be when the mines settle back into their normal
grooves. The reason for this is that only a few mines are now
working up to their full battery power, and, while costs are on the
full scale, results are less, surface dumps are being drawn upon for
mill service instead of the mine itself, owing to lack of full supply
of labour, &amp;c. When, however, the effects of the important fiscal
reductions just made have had time to exercise their effect in reducing
the cost of imported mining stores, foodstuffs, and the smaller
machinery and metal goods charged by the mines to the working
account, further reductions in the working costs will be possible.
Of the actual money value of this per ton of ore milled, various
opinions have been ventured. It has been estimated by experts
that it is possible under favouring circumstances to reduce the
expense of working by some 10s. per ton, at which rate ore yielding
over 5.6 dwt. per ton bullion could be made to yield a profit.
The importance of this not only in improving the present position
of all mining undertakings, but in stimulating the low-grade mines
to come into the working stage, can hardly be overestimated. With
the various difficulties besetting the mining industry removed, the
future working cost level should be lower than at any preceding
period, taking into account the benefit of the recent fiscal reductions
and other governmental assistance in prospect.</p>

<p>Allusion has been made to the probable continuation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Rand formation beyond its present area; but, as a matter of fact, the
Witwatersrand series of reefs, or an amplification of them, has been
more or less proved for a distance of nearly one hundred miles to
the north and south. The strike of the reefs is not uniformly continuous&mdash;in
fact, the reefs are intersected by quite a numerous series
of faults, and in many places they have been subjected to extensive
denudation, to the extent of complete obliteration of the outcrop in
places. Nevertheless at various points very remunerative mines
have been established, and although, on the whole, the character of
possessing a low-grade ore is attributed to these reefs, this is probably
due more to the very incomplete prospecting to which the
area has been subjected than to any actual lack contrasted with the
better known central section of the Rand. On this subject Mr.
Bleloch makes the apposite observation that &#8220;it is not reasonable
to think that only the richest portions of the Witwatersrand zones
have been laid open on the surface, and that the sections which
remain covered are poor. It is probable that many portions of
these hidden areas contain reefs, if not rich at least payable, and
this may especially be hoped for in that region where the reefs are
completely hidden, and at the two ends of which, where they are
exposed, they are found to be payable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eastern section of this greater Rand is about 30 miles in
extent, or 140 miles if the contours of the outcrops be followed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
In the western section the conglomerate may be followed for
90 miles as far as Klerksdorp, when the formation swerves back
to the Vaal River. So far back as 1890 gold-bearing reefs on
the banks of the Vaal River were known, and identified by experts
as the south-western rim of the Witwatersrand basin; but lack of
railway facilities and cheap coal then precluded their profitable
working. This district is now surrounded by railways, and the
circumstances are so improved that the possibility of creating a new
Rand in the locality is regarded as feasible by both experts and
capitalists, as, albeit only low-grade ore has as yet been met with,
this is properly held to be hardly a fair index of what lies below, for
experience in the Central Rand has shown that the reefs often
improve lower down. The recently reported &#8220;new discoveries&#8221; of
reefs actually refer to this particular district.</p>

<p>The prospect before these outlying areas of the Rand is
further authoritatively confirmed by a recent report of the Commissioner
of Mines, in which he observes: &#8220;While the expansion of the
Witwatersrand is certain, the future of mining in the outlying districts
will largely depend upon the introduction of a mining law which
will give greater facilities and hold out greater rewards to the individual
prospector and small capitalist.&#8221; This observation is true
regarding many other mining fields in the Transvaal besides that of
the Greater Rand.</p>

<p>Although in speaking of gold-mining in the Transvaal the Witwatersrand
is usually meant, it must not be lost sight of that the
Transvaal possesses other gold-fields of great potentialities and of
older date. The De Kaap fields in the Barberton district were the
object of attention before those of the Witwatersrand were discovered,
and at one time bulked hugely in the public eye. Unknown
reserves, both of alluvial and quartz gold, exist, those reefs of the
latter which have been worked yielding in many cases a much higher
ratio of gold to the ton than do the famed banket beds of the Witwatersrand.
The Sheba mine in this district, a case in point, is one
of the most remarkable gold mines in the world, nearly 90 feet of ore
having been taken out of some stopes. The quartz reefs extend
over a distance of 30 miles, mainly in the hilly districts, while the
alluvium occurs in most of the river valleys. The development of
the district in the past has been hampered by a number of remediable
causes, chief among which are unscientific working, monopolist
concessions, excessive railway and customs burdens, and general
governmental neglect. With the removal of these, gold-mining here
is believed by experts to offer prospects not inferior, perhaps, to
those of the Rand. The recent Government proclamation throwing
open the district to pegging, with the contemplated modifications in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the Gold Law favouring prospectors, are earnests that this splendid
mineral reserve will at last have that justice done to it which is its
due. Next in importance to the De Kaap gold-fields come those of
the Lydenburg district. The gold exists here in a similar quartz
reef formation, with, also, unusually rich alluvial tracts; but not one-tenth
of its resources are known, although since the start of the
workings an output valued at £2,000,000 sterling has been achieved.
A number of paying companies are at work, but the drawbacks under
which the development of these fields labour are very much those
which prevail on the Barberton fields. The northern gold-beds, including
the Zoutpansberg, Klein Letaba, Murchison, Selati, &amp;c., are
likewise of the quartz formation, and they have been worked to a
limited extent over a longer period than either of the two preceding
fields. The Murchison gold-belt is particularly noticeable among these
fields. The principal or southern reef, 18 inches in thickness, is said
to extend for 18 miles, and to be workable down to 1000 feet, and to
contain a gold contents of £25,000,000 sterling. The northern reef
is estimated to be capable of producing £20,000,000 of gold. Development
waits, in all these auriferous regions, primarily on the
provision of railway facilities to get up machinery and mining
requisites; and the extension of the Pietersburg line, which has been
promised, or the completion of the long-projected Selati railway from
where it left off, would be as the breath of life to the mining industry
here. Two other promising mining fields, generally separately
grouped but really a portion of the De Kaap system, are the Komati
or Steynsdorp and the Swazieland gold-fields. The former exists
on the Swazieland border, not far from Barberton, and is rightly
regarded as merely an outlier of the mineral formations of that
district. The numerous reefs have, however, only yielded as yet
low-grade and refractory ores. The Swazieland fields have only been
prospected in the north-west of that territory, but the results have
shown that a considerable body of ore exists. Its gold output in
1898 totalled 8256 oz. Minor fields are those of Malmani, on the
western border near Mafeking, the Pretoria quartz reefs, and the
banket beds of Vryheid (the last now incorporated into Natal). The
prospects of all these fields are very large, and their requirements
are alike. Conditions tending to lessen the cost of working, and
facilities to induce the advent of the prospector and to justify the
investment of capital, will reverse in their cases the dubious records
of the past, while adding immensely to the wealth of the Transvaal&#8217;s
gold production resources.</p>

<p>The sum of the foregoing observations is that the future of the
Transvaal mining industry presents a vista of incalculable prosperity.
In the restricted area of the Central Rand alone there is a treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of at least £2,871,000,000 awaiting appropriation; and, beyond this
huge sum, there are reserves in the Greater Rand which, reckoned
on the basis of mileage alone, would sixfold this amount. Moreover,
as the confines of the Rand reef formation have not yet been
determined, should they be found to stretch into Natal and Zululand
on the one hand, or into Rhodesia on the other, as recent
discoveries would seem to indicate, the productive possibilities of
the future are enlarged proportionately. Apart from its banket
reefs the Transvaal likewise possesses huge gold reserves in its
quartz reef fields in the De Kaap, Lydenburg, Zoutpansberg, and
other districts to the south-east, east, and north, not to speak of the
already opened and promising grounds on the extreme west, which
await development when the Rand conglomerate beds are exhausted,
if they do not&mdash;as in all probability they will&mdash;receive attention
beforehand. The value of these resources is attested by the best
of all evidence&mdash;that of actual productive yield in the past. In the
matter of circumstances, means, and paying results from mining, it
has been shown, and it is incontestible, that the industry now
stands, in every particular, upon a much more advantageous basis
than it ever enjoyed. As regards processes and mechanical appliances,
the new era opens with the substantial asset in hand represented
by the accumulated skill and knowledge of past painful and
costly experience and experiment, so that new mines making a start
may lay down their equipments with the greatest practical certainty
and economy and assurance of successful results, even on low-grade
properties previously deemed unremunerative. In respect of external
circumstances, the conditions are already so improved, or in
course of improvement, that working costs have been&mdash;and will be
more so in the future, when all the beneficent proposals contemplated
by the Government, and the local advantages resulting from the new
order of things have had time to come into operation&mdash;lessened to
the extent of yielding substantial accretions to the dividends of the
already paying mines, while facilitating the development of the
deeper mines, and the multitude of minor low-grade concerns
hitherto incapable of profitable working. Estimates have been
adventured in the earlier part of this chapter of the amount of the
saving of working costs to the extent of 10s. per ton, but this is a
pure approximation, and the actual outcome is likely to be twofold
or more. Similarly the yield of gold per year from the Rand
central district of 37 to 40 millions is only a rough estimate,
the production in the future, as in the past, being likely to be much
above the forecasts, taking into view the beneficent circumstances
which will henceforth rule, the full appraisement of which is at
present impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></p>

<p>Altogether, therefore, the outlook is one of undimmed brightness,
for the misgivings entertained in some quarters regarding new
taxation burdens to be imposed, calculated to hamper or hinder the
progress of the industry, must be allowed to have no shadow of
substance. The pronouncements of the Government hitherto, and
the recommendations of their Transvaal adviser, are clear on this
head. Taxation will naturally have to be borne, and the tax on
profits was accepted in principle by the mining industry before the
war. Its incidence, whatever be the amount, will only reduce to a
fractional extent that portion of the yield set apart for dividends,
which will bear the burden, whatever it be, with the greater
ease in view of the accretion of dividends rendered possible by the
new conditions. There are, indeed, grounds for assuming that a
part of the agitation on foot is lacking in singleness of aim, and
engineered by persons who have some secondary object to gain.
The rank and file of the mining industry, as well as the best sense
of the Anglo-Saxon community, has, however, confidence in the
Government that it will do nothing harmful to the best interests of
the new Colonies in general, and its staple industry in particular,
and, moreover, will be true to the English principle of inviting the
taxed to its councils. It is in this particular light that the visit of
the Secretary of State for the Colonies to South Africa has such
special interest at this juncture.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By LOUIS CRESWICKE</span></p>

<p>Almost the last message of that prophetic statesman
Rhodes was characteristic: &#8220;Support Milner through
thick and thin,&#8221; he curtly and emphatically said. It is
therefore Lord Milner&#8217;s opinion of the future settlement
of the country which should not merely be read, but
marked and learnt and inwardly digested, by all who are anxious
for the development of British interests in the new Colonies, and
who shrink from a recurrence of the horrible scenes of the past, which
owed their origin mainly to long years of vacillation on the part of
Governments that &#8220;swallowed up&#8221; the Boers at one moment only
to disgorge them the next. Lord Milner, as Mr. Chamberlain has
put it, &#8220;is the most effective instrument in our possession.&#8221; To
his subtle yet gigantic brain, to his detailed yet comprehensive
labours, we are indebted for a plan out of the chaos, a practical plan
by which Briton and Boer may be efficiently planted side by side
on the soil for the agricultural and political well-being of the newly-acquired
Colonies.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the agricultural resources of the
conquered territory have hitherto been inadequately developed. As
it was half a century ago, so it remains to-day&mdash;a pastoral country
importing its cereals, its dairy produce, and even its hay from
foreign parts. The motto of the Boer has never been &#8220;Forward,&#8221;
nor has industry been his strong point. The happy farmstead of
five thousand acres which served to keep his ancestor, served also
to keep him comfortably till the date of the war. Progress lay not
with him but with the British settlers in the region of the Rand,
or with the crafty Hollanders who pulled the wires of the misguided
autocrat whose ambitious aim was to &#8220;stagger humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sole appreciable advance came from Great Britain. While
mining hummed apace, agriculture crept laboriously; the country,
teeming with promise, remained in parts entirely barren, in others
overrun by the uncombatted yellow tulip or the incango, both weeds
deadly to the soil.</p>

<p>The veldt and the karroo, say the pessimists, offer no home
for the Englishman. They moreover aver that only so long as
the mines hold out will the settler remain in South Africa. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
there are others, Lord Kitchener and Lord Milner among them,
who see in the country the latent possibility of modern North
America, or, at least, a great agricultural future which will endure
long after the history of the mineral districts is a closed volume.
The science of irrigation in its most modern development&mdash;&#8220;the
foundation-stone on which can be built the permanent prosperity
of South Africa&#8221;&mdash;is capable of transforming the profitless deserts
into flowering gardens and fruitful orchards which in very few
years will do more than pay their way. But to properly develop
any scheme requiring eternal vigilance, industry, and foresight, it is
necessary that a goodly sprinkling of the enterprising British
population shall be dispersed all over the land, so that not in the
towns alone will the characteristics of the dominant race be maintained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 483px;"><a name="illustration_38" id="illustration_38"></a>

<span class="small">(Mixed grass and karroo veldt)</span>
</div>

<p>Some one has said South Africa must irrigate or perish. This
may be a truism; but it is also very certain that South Africa,
while irrigating, must offer homes to a leavening mass of sound
and desirable British settlers before the irrigation schemes under
discussion can effect the agricultural transformation which, in
British hands, might speedily come to pass. The nature of this
settlement and the expedition of it, from an economic, social, and
political point of view, is declared by Lord Milner to be of supreme
importance. A new and progressive farming population must rein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>force
the old; for, it is most essential &#8220;that the old condition of things
shall not be reproduced, in which the race division coincided almost
completely with a division of interests, the whole country population
being virtually Boer, while the bulk of the industrial and commercial
population was British.&#8221; The three great essentials of any successful
scheme, according to Lord Milner&#8217;s showing, are these: it must
have magnitude, it must deal with land of good quality, it must
attract settlers of the right kind. In the matter of magnitude there
are many and intricate questions to be discussed. Land settlement
must be undertaken on a large scale else it will be politically unimportant,
the Boer States will remain Boer States in all but name,
and any money advanced by the British speculator will be like the
talent hidden in a napkin&mdash;just a talent and nothing more, till the
end of the chapter! The Government must assert its paternity; it
must control, it must assist. On all sides simultaneous effort must
be made to march in time with the progressive note that, once
struck, must be continuously and consistently re-echoed throughout
the length and breadth of the new Colonies. The best quality of
land must invite the best quality of settler, though regulations must
be sufficiently elastic to meet the wants of the settler with capital,
and also those of the settler with little more than practical experience.
They must vary, too, with the varying character of the farms.
The reason for this necessity has concisely been explained by Lord
Milner: &#8220;Take only the broad distinction between dry and irrigated
farms, familiar to every South African. Evidently a much larger
area is required in the former than in the latter, while the experience
needed by the farmer would vary greatly in the two cases. In the
former he would be mainly employed in stock-raising, while in the
latter in the cultivation of cereals; and in favourable neighbourhoods
market gardening would be the most profitable industry. Australian
ranchers seem peculiarly suited to the high veldt, while the corn
lands of the &#8216;Conquered Territory&#8217; could have no better occupants
than young progressive farmers from the Scottish lowlands. And
there are intermediate types of farms suited to settlers of the most
varied experience and resources.&#8221;</p>

<p>A rough draft of the terms on which the Orange River Colony
Government proposed to offer Government land to British settlers
affords an insight into the big projects that are afoot. The draft was
submitted to the British Government about the middle of 1902 in
order that sanction might be given to the principle of the conditions
set forth. Here&mdash;abbreviated&mdash;are the conditions of lease:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The settler shall pay the annual rent due by him to the Government
in half-yearly instalments, the first of which shall be due six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
months after his taking possession. The settler holding under a
lease shall have the right, with the approval of the Government, at
any time after the completion of his first year&#8217;s tenancy, to enter
upon the system of purchase by instalments, by giving three months&#8217;
notice to the Government of his intention to do so before the date
when his next half-yearly instalment falls due. In that case his
leasehold tenure shall be held to cease from the date of the payment
of such instalment, and he shall be entitled to acquire the land on
the same terms as a settler taking it on the purchase system, save
and except that he shall not have a year&#8217;s grace before beginning to
purchase by instalments, but that the first of his sixty half-yearly
instalments shall become due six months after the date of his last
payment under the lease. Every lease shall be for five years, but
shall be renewable at the option of the settler for a further period of
five or ten years.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The grounds on which the Government may cancel the lease
shall be the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Failure to pay in full any half-yearly instalment of rent, or any
sum due in respect of advances within three months of its becoming
due.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neglect to cultivate the land in a proper and husbandlike
manner to the satisfaction of the Government, or to apply any
money advanced by the Government for the purpose specified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Conviction for any criminal offence punishable by death or by
imprisonment without option of a fine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Government will be prepared to make advances to the
settler for such permanent improvements as the Government may
approve, such as drainage, fencing, farm buildings, tree-planting,
the sinking of wells, making of roads, reclamation of waste land, or
any other work calculated to permanently enhance the value of the
land, provided&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;That the sum of such advances shall not at any time exceed
the capital which the settler has himself expended, or can satisfy the
Government that he is prepared to expend, in connection with the
cultivation of the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the total outstanding amount at any one time shall not
exceed five times the rent of the land.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>All advances made by the Government in accordance with the
foregoing section shall be repaid by the settler with interest at £5
per centum within ten years by twenty equal half-yearly instalments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the conditions of purchase it is stated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The settler shall acquire the freehold of the land by paying
to the Government for the period of thirty years an annual sum
amounting to £5, 15s. per centum of the purchase price. This
annual sum shall be paid in two half-yearly instalments of £2, 17s. 6d.
per centum of such price.... If the settler affix to his holding any
engine, machinery, or any other fixture, or erect a building which he
is not authorised by the Government to affix or erect, the said
fixture or building shall be the property of the settler and removable
by him within a reasonable time after the cancellation of his contract,
provided that he first discharges all debts due by him to the
Government, and that after the removals he makes good any
unavoidable damage thereby occasioned. The settler must give
one month&#8217;s notice of his intention to remove such fixture or building,
and on receipt of such notice the Government may elect to
purchase such fixtures or building after a valuation as provided for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>During the currency of the contract of purchase the settler will
not be liable to pay any quit-rent or land-tax, or to make any other
payment to the Government than those provided for by the contract.
But from the time of the land becoming the freehold of the settler
under any of the provisions it shall be subject to any quit-rent or
land tax payable to the Government, to which any other freehold
land may from time to time be subject, according to the laws of the
Orange River Colony. The settler shall be liable, both before and
after the acquisition of the freehold, to pay any rates which may be
lawfully levied on the land for local purposes, but such rates shall
not, during the period of thirty and a half years from the date of the
settler&#8217;s taking possession under the contract of purchase, exceed 1d.
per £1 per annum of the purchase price of the land.</p>

<p>In reply to the Colonial Secretary&#8217;s telegram stating his belief
that the settlement of farmers from England would not be successful
unless the farms were close together, Lord Milner answered: &#8220;I
quite agree that farmers from home should not be isolated. But we
want farms of various characters. Dry farms, as you suppose, are
much in demand by Australians. I have a number of excellent
applicants of this class, and could to-morrow dispose of twice as
many dry farms as we possess in healthy parts of the Transvaal to
selected Australasians who have served in war and have agricultural
experience and some capital. Generally speaking, I do not think
it desirable to encourage agricultural settlers from home. It
would be better to give the first chance to the men on the spot,
whether oversea colonists or yeomen. This would not permanently
exclude men from home, as a long time must elapse before we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
deal with some of the land we have, and I hope to go on acquiring
more. But land immediately available should be offered to those
already here who cannot afford to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything mainly depends on the size of the settlement scheme.
To be of use it must be rapidly pushed forward with all the vigour
that the Government can bring to bear on the subject. The ball,
once effectively set rolling, would then move by the force of its
own impetus. First some three or four thousand settlers on land
acquired by Government would set the example, and quickly, round
them would flock private persons from the oversea Colonies or
Great Britain who, discovering that the Government meant business,
would follow suit, acquire land, and settle down in British constellations,
so that the sharp social and political division between town
and country would cease to exist and the past state of agricultural
stagnation could never return. Thus, much would be done &#8220;to
consolidate South African sentiment in the general interests of the
Empire.&#8221;</p>

<br />
<span class="small">(A typical stone-faced earth bank of a water dam in foreground)</span>
</div>

<p>In regard to the quality of the land, a very small quantity of the
land available in the Transvaal is suited to British settlers, and but
little, though excellent, Government land is to be obtained in the
Orange River Colony. In both Colonies most of the land is privately
owned. Much of this land may come into the market, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
many farmers may be found willing to part with a portion of their
property in order to obtain capital for the restocking of the other
portion. But, thinks Lord Milner, unless the Government is armed
with a general power of expropriation&mdash;not necessarily for use save
in emergency&mdash;it will be impossible to get sufficient land, or even to
make the best use of the land we already have or may hereafter
acquire by voluntary purchase. For, knowing his Boer through
and through, he rightly assumes that one or two recalcitrant owners
might prevent an irrigation scheme for a whole district, or otherwise
obstruct the distribution of a given area into farms suitable for
settlers. But, far from wishing to dispossess the Boer farmer and
create a class of landless and discontented men, Lord Milner expresses
his belief that it is our duty and interest to preserve the
Boer as a farmer though not as a large negligent landowner.
Unless land is purchased and British settlers are speedily installed,
an opportunity will be lost which will never recur, and neglect of the
present may endanger the future peace and prosperity of South
Africa. In fact, the key to the situation, the key to the gate which
will let in a steady influx of agricultural immigrants, is made up of
two things&mdash;powers of expropriation and money.</p>

<p>There are naturally many quibblers belonging to the &#8220;Foreigners&#8217;
friend and Britons&#8217; foe&#8221; party who look askance at these proposals,
and, indeed, at any proposals which might endow colonisation with
what they call a political, but which should properly be termed an Imperial,
trend. The idea of outnumbering the Dutch inhabitants seems
to them preposterous&mdash;even vindictive. They would prefer the
British Government and the British taxpayers, in matters connected
with their own policy and their own expenditure, to be out-voiced
by the inhabitants of the territory they have spent blood and treasure
to conquer. But to discuss the arguments of these quibblers
would be sheer waste of time and of space. Obstructions ever have
their value. As the impediment in the shell of the oyster brings
about the growth of the pearl, so the obstruction in the bivalve of
politics has brought forth the jewel of Imperial solidarity.</p>

<p>But it may as well be mentioned that the expropriation
suggestion which also excites the ire of Radicals, is by no
means an invention solely directed against the Boers in the conquered
States. The precedent is to be found in the legislation
of New Zealand. The Land for Settlements Act, 1894, enables
the Government of that Colony, if no private agreement can be
arrived at, to take land compulsorily for settlement, subject to a
price fixed by valuation and a certain compensation.</p>

<p>As regards settlers&mdash;the third great essential of Lord Milner&#8217;s
scheme&mdash;the future looks rosy enough. There are many who served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in the war and have a right to preference, who are eager to live
on the land and farm it, and who do not seek to acquire it merely
as a speculation or a makeshift. Hundreds of hale and hearty
fellows, men of experience and resource, men who have the pluck
to succeed, and men who have the courage to challenge failure,
have already offered themselves and wait patiently till their turn
may arrive. Were the land forthcoming, it would not be exaggeration
to say that some 10,000 and more of our fellow-countrymen
would be cultivating it within the twelvemonth.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">NATAL</h3>

<p>The progressive mood of Natal should afford sufficient encouragement
to even the most wary speculators. Here, for the
purpose of attracting tenant farmers, the plan is to form agricultural
settlements resembling the close colonies of New Zealand, the
settlements to be planted on areas irrigated by Government works.
According to Sir Albert Hime, irrigation here intensifies cultivation
tenfold, and so enables a farmer to get his living off one-tenth of
the amount of land that would otherwise be required, and furthermore
assures his crop. Owing to the broken nature of the country,
the irrigable areas are small in size and suited mainly for supporting
settlements of small cultivators. Such settlements, wherever started,
however, have proved unmistakably prosperous, and it only remains
for the Natal Government to introduce its scheme of close
settlements to the notice of the right form of emigrant in order to
render the &#8220;Garden Colony&#8221; eternally rich in green things upon the
earth. At present sugar-planting, thanks to the system of central
mills, is in a flourishing state. The same may be said of tea-planting,
which owes much to the continuous efforts of Sir J. L.
Hulett, whose &#8220;gardens&#8221; are the most important in Natal.</p>

<p>The demand for the wattle bark is on the increase. This tree
(<i>Acacia Mollissima</i>), originally brought from Australia, soon became
acclimatised in Natal, where there are now 50,000 acres of wattle
plantation. The wattle bark is exported to England, while the
tree&mdash;stripped of its bark&mdash;serves for poles which are much in
demand in the Rand mines. It is said that land for wattle-growing
may be purchased at from eighteen to twenty-five shillings an acre, the
cost of ploughing and planting may be estimated at from thirty-two to
fifteen shillings an acre. It takes some six years before cutting down
can be begun, but then, the probable net profits would be nearly half
the gross returns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;"><a name="illustration_40" id="illustration_40"></a>
<img src="images/illustration_40.png" width="445" height="289" alt="A KAFFIR VILLAGE." title="" />
<span class="caption">A KAFFIR VILLAGE.</span>
</div>

<p>With the development of the Rand the demand for timber will
increase by leaps and bounds, and the market for wattle bark as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
a tanning material will advance proportionately. As an instance
of the increase in the demand for bark, it may be stated that the
exports were valued at £69,850 in 1901 as against £30,929 in 1898.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, expansion and development will be the direct result
of irrigation. To those interested in South Africa, the future,
whether prospectively considered or practically discussed, must
hinge on the water-supply and the cunning practice of water-storage.</p>

<p>Mr. Willcocks (now Sir William Willcocks) of the Egyptian
Irrigation Department, one of the most experienced men, indeed
one of the greatest experts in irrigation in the world, when asked
to contribute to this volume, said &#8220;it would indeed afford him
much pleasure to co-operate,&#8221; but, owing to the great pressure of
affairs, he could not do credit to any other work he might undertake.
But his report on South Africa is so admirable an exposition of the
possibilities of the country, seen from the then standpoint, that merely
to quote some of its most salient features were preferable to inviting
the opinion of a lesser authority.</p>

<p>Plainly, the expert tells us that, with the exception of the south-west
corner of the Cape Colony, the &#8220;conquered territory&#8221; of the
Orange River Colony, and the high veldt of the Transvaal, the
agricultural development of the whole country depends on irrigation.
The high-lying plateau of South Africa has by its situation a rainfall
suited to tropical countries, and, owing to its altitude, a climate which
belongs to a temperate zone. The autumn rains of February and
March, which are monsoon rains, would in a country like India be
of infinite value; but followed, as they are in South Africa, by a
severe and biting winter, they are of little value for agricultural
purposes. The long winter and spring drought, and the uncertain
summer rains, absolutely prohibit agriculture of any advanced kind.
In certain favoured tracts&mdash;such as a fifth of Cape Colony, half the
Orange River Colony, and two-thirds of the Transvaal&mdash;Indian
corn, potatoes, roots generally, and pumpkins for feeding stock in
winter, can be grown with the aid of the rainfall, and matured in all
but years of heavy drought. By means of crop rotations, suitable
manures, and good tillage, agricultural development of no mean
value could be accomplished within a decade, especially if taken in
conjunction with stock-breeding, the principal industry of the
country. But, in other parts of the colonies, water comes when it
is of no value, and is absent when it would be worth untold gold.
To avoid this inconvenience, Mr. Willcocks says, we have only to
imitate nature and impound on the surface of the ground the same
water which she stores in caverns and fissures; and for instance
of what even inferior water may do with the rich soil of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Africa, he gives the Kenilworth Oasis (within a few miles of Kimberley),
which is irrigated by the refuse water of the diamond mines.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the annual rainfall is sufficient to allow of
the storage of water on a very large scale. Cape Colony with the
aid of its rainfall, together with the Orange River, should be able to
ensure the perennial irrigation of 1,000,000 acres, the Orange River
Colony of 750,000 acres, and the Transvaal of 500,000 acres in the
high-lying regions and 1,000,000 in the low tracts, which tracts Mr.
Willcocks recommends should be thrown open to our fellow British-Indian
subjects.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;"><a name="illustration_41" id="illustration_41"></a>
<img src="images/illustration_41.png" width="412" height="302" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Vermont Merino Ewes</span>
</div>

<p>Seeing that agriculture without irrigation is generally impossible
throughout the new colonies, it must be admitted that the secret of
their development lies first and foremost in the ingenious storage of
water. The rainfall is like the traditional Offenbachian policemen,
&#8220;when wanted, never there,&#8221; and when it is not wanted it is invariably
present. Therefore it is necessary for the Government to
proclaim the countries themselves as arid or semi-arid, and legislate
accordingly. Italian irrigation laws may be taken as a model for all
arid and semi-arid countries in the possession of Europeans. The
Government of Cavour decreed the rivers and torrents as public
property, and, as such, the property of the Government representing
the people. Ancient and vague irrigation rights standing in the way
of legislation were promptly disposed of, and the Government set
itself to legislate for future concessions, to which wise and strong
measure modern Italy owes much of its prosperity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>It is decided that all important irrigation works should be
carried forth by the State, and not, as in America, by individuals
or concessionaire companies, for experience shows that private
enterprise has often disastrous results, because of the difficulty in
realising immediate returns from the investment. The slow and
sure methods of a Government in the control of the works&mdash;their
construction, ownership, and administration&mdash;is the only successful
method. Such works, well conceived and well executed, bring in a
direct benefit to the State if allowed to develop on slow and natural
lines; they also bring in indirect benefits which a State reaps from
increase of wealth of every kind.</p>

<p>With the increased demand for agricultural labour, caused by the
development of the country, the poor white problem will be solved.
The sole kind of manual labour which appeals to the poor white is
agricultural labour, since he cannot work in competition with black
labour.</p>

<p>Mr. Willcocks considers that, in order to save the country from
dropping from the height of prosperity to poverty, part of the
profits of the mines should be invested in irrigation works for the
permanent development of the country. &#8220;The mineral wealth of
the Transvaal is extraordinarily great, but it is exhaustible, some
say in within the space of fifty, others within the space of a hundred,
years. It would be a disaster, indeed, for the country, if none of
this wealth were devoted to the development of its agriculture.
Agricultural development is slow, but it is permanent and knows of
no exhaustion.&#8221; After recommending the adoption of the metric
system of weights and measures&mdash;which is superior to all other
systems&mdash;he takes the sections of the three colonies and describes
them in detail. The technicalities of irrigation must be studied
separately, but the characteristics of the country are interesting
to all.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">THE SOUTH-WESTERN CORNER OF THE CAPE COLONY</h3>

<p>The abundant winter rains render this, one of the wheat districts
of the Colony, independent of irrigation in winter. The farms, in
size about 2000 acres, appear too large to be profitably worked by
poor farmers. Ploughing is done perfunctorily, and no rotation of
leguminous crops with serials is attempted, because it is believed
that there is no market in Cape Town for beans and other
legumins. Mr. Willcocks suggests as a remedy the construction
of an agricultural railway through this district, so that the disposal
of fodder would be simplified. He also proposes the exchange of
seeds between Egypt, which is rich in legumins, and the Colony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
which is rich in fodders capable of existing in conditions of extreme
drought. He thinks the luscious emerald burseem (Egyptian
clover), grown in rotation with wheat, might stock the soil with
nitrogen and possibly destroy the rust in wheat which is universally
complained of. Indeed he declares that legumins might be grown
with cereals all over the Colony with great benefit to agriculture.
Lentils are a wholesome and sustaining fare, and beans form the
principal food of donkeys and poultry in Egypt. In India horses,
sheep, and cattle, Mr. Willcocks says, are fed on &#8220;gram,&#8221; another
lentil; and the present writer can testify to more than that, for not
only do the horses fatten, but so also do the families of the native
&#8220;syces&#8221; employed to take care of them! This proves that gram, if
properly used, is as nourishing for the biped as for the quadruped
world. But the art of using the lentil is not generally known. The
lentil worked into a purée, and diluted and warmed with curry
gravy, makes one of the finest adjuncts to the breakfast-table
imaginable. Served hot in a sauce tureen it can be eaten with fish,
hard-boiled eggs, biscuits, or any other light food which may be at
hand. This sauce supplies the stamina and flavour of a meal.</p>

<p>To return. The Wynberg district is famed for its vineyards,
which, lately, have suffered through phylloxera. Much of the grape-juice
is converted into the brandy that works such havoc with the
natives. Mr. Willcocks proposes as an alternative the introduction
of the resinous firs common in Greece for the purpose of converting
the grapes into the light wines which are manufactured by the Greek
farmers; but it is to be feared that the native palate, tutored to
the smack of more fiery fluid, will not approve the delicate flavour
of the resinato wines.</p>

<p>In regard to the Breede River Valley, expensive river and canal
works will be needed to properly irrigate the district, but these will
repay the expenditure. In the Touws River Valley, in years of
ordinary winter rain, good wheat crops can be grown on the
alluvium of the river, which crops might be made permanent by the
construction of fifteen-feet high weirs at suitable sites, and the leading
off of small canals from the up-stream sides.</p>

<p>In the karoo veldt, in the Prince Albert district, the light rainfall,
together with the violent slope of the country, renders numerous
irrigation schemes impossible. But the karoo bushes need and are
worth development, otherwise they will in time be exterminated.
Our authority gives in detail a scheme by which this development
may be accomplished, and declares that if the right method of preservation
were adopted, it would probably be possible to feed three
sheep where one can be fed to-day.</p>

<span class="small">Reproduced by permission from the Natal Government Collection</span>
</div>

<p>The Oudtshoorn district is the garden of the Cape Colony. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
enjoys a splendid climate and water-supply. The speciality of the
Oudtshoorn Valley is ostrich farming. The birds in thousands feed
in the lucerne fields on the banks of the Oliphants River. Crops of
tobacco and potatoes, orange groves, vineyards and orchards are
everywhere to be seen. There are still some 70,000 acres of land in
the valley capable of development by irrigation if water could be
found for them&mdash;and here many schemes are possible. &#8220;Unirrigated
land in the valley, on which there falls annually from seven to
ten inches of rain, is worth scarcely £1 an acre; while the same
land, when irrigated, is worth from £30 to £100 per acre.&#8221; It is
impossible here to describe the practical remedies and improvement
schemes suggested; the object of quotation is merely to give on
authority, a concise outline of the rich vista that has been extended
before us, and the perpetual prosperity that may be secured to the
South African Continent if the Government should consent to adopt
the measures suggested.</p>

<p>In the advanced farms stock are watered from tanks fed by subsoil
water raised by windmills. Wherever there are no permanent
springs these mills, Mr. Willcocks thinks, might be made compulsory.
He says: &#8220;I have seen stock drinking from shallow pools
which contained mud rather than water, and in which dead sheep
were festering. It might be possible to legislate that, if a reservoir
is constructed, it must be fenced round and protected from entry by
stock. The reservoir dam should be pierced by a pipe discharging
into a trough, from which cattle should be given to drink.&#8221; This
would protect the water from pollution and save the cattle from
contracting rinderpest and spreading it all over the country.</p>

<p>The farms have a general area of some 12,000 acres each, with
about twelve acres of cultivated land per farm. This means about
one acre of arable land to a thousand acres of pastoral land. The
cultivated area is divided thus&mdash;one acre of fruit or vegetable garden
to about eleven acres under wheat, Indian corn, lucerne, and oat-hay.
Here, the veldt will carry one sheep&mdash;these are principally merinos&mdash;or
a goat, to four acres; or one ox to sixteen acres.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>North of Britstown the pan and vale formation begins, a formation
consisting of alternate ridges of rounded dolomite hills and flat
depressions which are either vales or pans. Vales have outlets for
the water which collects in them, pans usually have none. Some
are natural reservoirs of great capacity. The pans, when not brack,
are the natural reservoirs of the country. Mr. Willcocks has shown
how both pans and vales may be dealt with to the best advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and how the direct storage of water and the indirect storage of
it should be effected.</p>

<p>Still touring in the Cape Colony, he turned his attention to the
Kat, Kabossi, Keishma, Klipparts, and other streams near the sea,
which have a perennial discharge with a minimum of about 100 cubic
feet per second, yet which are scarcely utilised. On this subject
he reported: &#8220;The value of this water near the sea will never be
appreciated till the idea is abandoned that cereals are the only crops
worth growing and that manures are not necessary. The attempt
to grow cereals year after year without manure and without rotation
of crops has made the wheat crops so liable to rust that agriculture
is discounted everywhere near the sea. Wherever perennial water
of any kind can be obtained in the important stock districts of the
Eastern Provinces, lucerne, at least, might be planted to the utmost
limits of the water.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Pure Negretti Merino Ram</span>
</div>

<p>Locusts are ubiquitous; but these in the footganger stage might
be easily destroyed before they could develop into the pest they
now are. Mr. Willcocks thus describes a mode of dealing with
them: &#8220;At the foot of some low hills in the karoo bush I came
across great numbers of the footgangers. They were jet black, and
were very easily distinguished. Indeed it appeared as though some
giant had just walked over the veldt and sprinkled it with great
splashes of jet-black ink. If I had been a Kaffir, and had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
that a reward would have been given for the location of locusts in
this stage, it would have been a simple matter to have gone to the
nearest magistrate and reported the appearance of the footgangers.
A few men, with washing soap and water and sprays could have
killed many millions in a few hours.&#8221; He proposes that the States
should combine and annually devote £20,000 to the extermination
of these creatures before they take wing and become uncombatable.
The idea is an excellent one; but the method of carrying it into effect
will need to be &#8220;slim&#8221; in its strictures, otherwise the remedy, in
homeopathic fashion, may be productive of the disease! In India,
for instance, where several annas are offered for every deadly snake
destroyed, these pests are occasionally cherished and bred as a
comfortable source of income. In the Deccan, a few years since, a
nest of these reptiles was discovered near the writer&#8217;s bungalow,
and the farming process was explained by an Anglo-Indian friend.
Every dead snake being worth three or four annas, it was to the
interest of the enterprising native to rear as many as possible, so
that when hard up he could slay one of his &#8220;stock&#8221; and receive the
coveted reward!</p>

<p>The Aliwal North, Herschel, and New England districts lie
between 4500 and 6000 feet above sea-level, and have a rainfall of
some thirty inches per annum. A good Indian corn crop may be
counted on every year, and wheat in five years out of six. Only a
third of the cultivable area is put under cultivation, though the
grasses are good and one acre can support a sheep. Agriculture
is generally backward, rotations of crops and manuring being unknown.
Turnips and swedes for winter feeding of stock have been
raised with success.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">BASUTOLAND</h3>

<p>Basutoland has a better rainfall than any part of South Africa, except
Natal and the south-western corner of Cape Colony. The maximum
fall per annum, save in years of drought, may be put at thirty-five
inches, the minimum at twenty-eight. It is nearly always sufficient to
allow of wheat being sown between July and August, and reaped in
December without irrigation. About one-third of cultivated land is
devoted to wheat, a third to Indian corn, and a third to millets.
These last are sown between the middle of September and the middle
of November, and are reaped in April. No rotations of cereals
with leguminous crops are practised; no manure is used. Cultivation
has been going on for thirty years, and the soil is by no means
as productive as it was originally.</p>

<p>According to the authority of Mr. Willcocks, if suitable manures
were employed and careful cultivation gone in for, this country with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
its friable soil should be eminently suitable for all root crops, such
as potatoes, onions, and turnips, while beetroot would answer
admirably in the valley of the Caledon River up-stream to Ladybrand,
and in the main tributaries of the Caledon. The denudation
of the country&mdash;owing to the numerous ravines which cut it up&mdash;is
serious, and, if allowed to continue, it will mean incalculable loss.
The scouring action of the water is aggravated by the fact that the
Basuto villages are built on the tops of the hills. The steeps are
constantly worn into tracks by the women-carriers of water from
the springs, and these tracks become during the rain a series of
rivulets which contribute further to the general denudation. To
save the land from the fate of Palestine, which, in somewhat the same
way, became denuded by hundreds of years of cultivation and intense
habitation, an ingenious arrangement for planting willow and
poplar cuttings in damp ravines, and wattles and aloes in the dry
ones, has been described by Mr. Willcocks&mdash;a remedy which at
the outset seems costly, but will finally become self-supporting.
The young trees will be pollarded and produce fuel, which is badly
needed in this at present extraordinarily treeless region; and it is
even possible that if the ravines were filled with trees it might result
in an increased rainfall during the critical months of August, September,
and October.</p>

<p>Nothing in the way of irrigation can here be done without
reservoirs, and these would pay nowhere but near the important
centres. But more important than irrigation, and much less costly,
would be a better system of cultivation, the introduction of leguminous
crops and roots in rotation with cereals. Experimental
ventures by means of model farms would soon prove what were the
most suitable legumins and roots for the country, and the best
manures. Once initiated, the intelligent Basutos would rapidly
improve upon their limited experiences; but whether they would
acquire a taste for a diet of pulses, on the cultivation of which the
future development of the country depends, is another matter.</p>

<p>Patriotically, it seems reasonable to demand the education of the
appetite of a people in accordance with the output of their native
land. The young of a nation should be taught to acquire a taste
for healthy home-grown fare, and the women-folk should be instructed
in the art of manipulating it to the profit of the household.
What is applicable in Basutoland is applicable all over South Africa.
The urban population must assist agriculture or it cannot be made
to pay. The produce of the farms must find a market at its elbow,
so to say; for there can be no profits if enormous charges for rail
have to be met and the farmers are thrust into competition with the
American and European markets.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">&#8220;THE CONQUERED TERRITORY&#8221;</h3>

<p>The south-eastern corner of the Orange River Colony, in the
region of Harrismith, Ficksburg, Ladybrand, and Wepener, is
considered the best suited for European settlers. Springs are
numerous. Wheat and Indian corn are the principal crops. The
flour-mills on the Caledon can be worked for nine months yearly,
and the land on both sides of it is full of promise to the agriculturist.
Improvements in the form of weirs, &amp;c., are suggested, by which
one-fourth of the area would be insured in nine years out of
ten. &#8220;It would be possible to put some 50,000 acres under
lucerne; 12,000 acres, or, if necessary, the whole 24,000 acres under
beetroot, for which soil, climate, and seasons are most favourable.&#8221;
Thus would be introduced an important sugar industry into the
country.</p>

<p>In the north-eastern half of the Orange River Colony perennial
irrigation would ensure as good crops, but at a greater expenditure
of water. Here the value of perennially irrigated land to land depending
on rainfall may be taken as £1 to one shilling in this
district, on the high veldt of the Transvaal, and in the south-eastern
corner of the Orange River Colony. In the south-western half of
the Orange River Colony, it may be taken as £1 to sixpence; in
the Eastern Karroo as £1 to threepence; and in the Western Karroo
as £1 to a penny. In the north-eastern half of the Orange River
Colony the good veldt may be taken as £1 per acre, and perennially
irrigated land as £20 per acre.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>After inquiry, observation, and comparison with other countries,
Mr. Willcocks&#8217; estimate of the price which could be paid for perennial
irrigation is as follows: In parts which lie below 1000 feet
above sea-level, situated in the arid or semi-arid region, a water-rent
of £2 per annum could be easily paid anywhere near a railway. In
semi-arid regions, between 1000 and 2500 feet, a water-rent of £1,
10s. could be paid. Over 2500 feet in height, £1 per acre per
annum could be paid. Near important centres the rent could be
higher.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">THE TRANSVAAL</h3>

<p>The Transvaal, for agricultural purposes, may be divided into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
dolomite region,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the high, low, and bush veldt, and the south-eastern
tracts. The most important is the dolomite region, which, roughly
speaking, covers the country within lines joining Vereeniging, Heidelberg,
Bethel, Pretoria, Rustenburg, Zeerust, Lichtenburg, Klerksdorp,
and the Vaal River from Klerksdorp to Vereeniging&mdash;an area of about
15,000 square miles. Johannesburg&#8217;s rainfall&mdash;from twenty-eight
inches per annum in the east to twenty-two inches in the west&mdash;is the
best in the district. Though uncertain in September, October, and November,
in January, February, and March rain can always be counted
on. The country generally is capable of great agricultural development,
an area of some 350,000 acres being capable of perennial irrigation,
in addition to the areas irrigated by the existing springs. In
addition to the agricultural value of perennially irrigated land, there is
the land which without the aid of irrigation can be so cultivated as
to give excellent yields, for it is proved that well-manured and tilled
crops need only half the rainfall that ill-manured and untilled crops
require.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;"><a name="illustration_45" id="illustration_45"></a>
<img src="images/illustration_45.png" width="341" height="355" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Angora Goat (Young Ewe)</span>
</div>

<p>In the high veldt the rainfall, taken at twenty-one inches, occurs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
January, February, and March. The veldt grass will support one
sheep per acre. Mr. Willcocks thinks that in this region&mdash;it is
enclosed by lines drawn from Vereeniging to Heidelberg, Pretoria,
Belfast, Amsterdam, Vryheid, Volksrust, Standerton, and the line of
the Vaal River&mdash;it would be more profitable to thoroughly develop
the unirrigated crops than to go in for perennial irrigation. The
higher the altitude in South Africa the less the value of perennial
water, except under special conditions. Perennial irrigation should
first be confined to centres such as Middelburg, Standerton, and
other towns which, with this aid, would give handsome profits.</p>

<p>The annual trek from the high to the low veldt in winter might
be dispensed with if sufficient winter food crops were grown with
the aid of the rainfall, and the stock herded in winter in cattle and
sheep folds sheltered by groves of blue gum or pine trees. The
practice of trekking from high to low veldt in winter, is due to the
fact that winter frosts kill the grass in the high veldt, and the
farmers, in default of other food-stuffs for flocks, are forced to travel
to the regions where frost is unknown. Naturally, the trekking results
in 10,000 acres of veldt having to do the work of 5000. To double
the value of their holdings in the high veldt, and save the trouble of
the trek, the farmers need only to plant a few belts of sheltering trees,
and cultivate roots and feeding stuff for flocks and herds.</p>

<p>The low veldt, being well supplied with water, could finally
become a possession of great value. The climate being unsuited to
Europeans, the place has remained undeveloped; but the land, if set
apart, might be made self-supporting, indeed a source of appreciable
revenue to the country, if British Indians and Kafirs were encouraged
to produce rice, tropical plants, &amp;c., which would in no way compete
with the temperate and sub-tropical crops of the European farmers
in the other regions. &#8220;If,&#8221; says Mr. Willcocks, &#8220;Indians and
Kafirs were confined to the tropical belts, and the Europeans to
the temperate belts, we should not see the absurd spectacle which
we see to-day of the best parts of the temperate zones being
inhabited almost exclusively by Kafirs, while the Europeans with
great jealousy are keeping the Indians and Kafirs out of the
tropical belts.&#8221;</p>

<p>No wholesale improvements in arid or semi-arid regions can be
carried forward without land and water taxes, for individuals that
are exempt might neglect to improve the land with impunity, and
the State would be powerless to interfere to prevent whole regions
lying waste and barren.</p>

<p>There is said to be scarcely a part of South Africa where
agriculturists cannot afford to pay £1 per acre per annum for
perennially irrigated land, and the system of irrigation as put before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the Government shows that this uniform rate would enable extensive
projects to be undertaken everywhere with profit.</p>

<p>Land tax is another question to be considered. Land in Orange
River Colony may be considered as having a mean value of 15s.
per acre. The suggested tax is 6d. per acre per annum. The
effect of such tax would be to weed the country of useless landowners,
and replace them by industrious and progressive farming
men. On a basis of 6d. per acre per annum, the Orange River
Colony could pay £300,000 per annum.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal the dolomite region, the high veldt, and the
south-eastern corner&mdash;taken as worth 10s. an acre, and taxed at 4d.
per acre&mdash;would bring in annually some £350,000. As in the Orange
Colony, irrigation works would add materially to the revenue.
There would at first be protests from all quarters, but eventually
this systematic taxation would prevent worthless landlords from
accumulating property to the detriment of progressive practical men.</p>

<p>In order to protect and improve the position of the farmers,
Mr. Willcocks recommends the formation of a Bureau of Agriculture
after the pattern of the Agricultural Bureau at Washington. Its
representatives collect information from far and near, and of every
possible kind, sending to headquarters all manner of agricultural
produce. Experimental farms are started in the various states,
curious seeds are sown, and if any variety proves adaptable to any
particular region, the farmers are promptly provided with seed corn,
and thus assisted to keep at the head of the world in agricultural
production. Such a bureau in South Africa would cause its agents
to import legumins from Egypt, and labour-saving machines from
America, which last would halve the expenditure on watercourses
and earthwork of all classes.</p>

<p>Taken all round, South Africa with the addition of 3,000,000
acres of perennially irrigated land (gained at an expenditure of
£30,000,000, and valued at £100,000,000), and also with 10,000,000
acres of land under crops depending on rainfall (which might be
valued at another £100,000,000), would be a very different country
from that which it is to-day. In view of this immensely rich outlook,
no South African statesman should rest content with the
transitory mineral wealth of the moment, or the golden glories of a
possible fifty years. Irrigation, and irrigation alone, can secure
permanent wealth to any part of the South African continent, and
the Government that refuses to recognise the vital importance of a
sufficiently comprehensive land and irrigation scheme, and that
hesitates while the land is ripe for regeneration&mdash;that Government
will deservedly go down to posterity as the Government of lost
opportunities.</p>

<p>The Cape Colony, including the Transkeian Territories, may,
from a pastoral point of view, be divided into three parts:
first, the grass country of the east and south-east, 37,722
square miles in extent; second, the mixed grass and karroo,
in the north, centre, and south-west, comprising an area of
57,617 square miles; and third, the karroo proper, in the west and
north-west, which includes 125,747 square miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;"><a name="illustration_47" id="illustration_47"></a>

<br />
<span class="small">(The stone walls of the kraal are coped with cakes of &#8220;mist,&#8221; or dried sheep manure)</span>
</div>

<p>Of these divisions the smallest in extent&mdash;the Grass Country&mdash;is
the most heavily stocked, some portions carrying as many as from
four to five hundred sheep to the square mile. Although the natural
pasture may not compare favourably with that of other stock-raising
countries, it possesses advantages which cannot be surpassed elsewhere
in the Colony. The flocks grazed in this locality are, generally
speaking, superior in breed, and the wool is light, clean, and well
grown, commanding the highest prices realised for Cape clips.
Fencing has been systematically and extensively carried out, and
with but few exceptions, every farm is enclosed, and subdivided into
paddocks, at a cost of from £35 to £50 per mile.</p>

<p>Along the coast, and for some miles inland, the grass grows rank
and sour, and is only eaten by stock when in the young and succulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
stage. Later in the season, when the pasture becomes dry and
woody, it is quite unfit for grazing purposes. In these parts merino
sheep are rarely found, the ravages of a disease named Heartwater
having denuded the farms of all small stock, with the exception of
the common or Boer goat, which thrives fairly well, and is kept in
small flocks for milking and slaughter.</p>

<p>The soil of the grass veldt being deficient in lime, the stock
naturally crave for salt, and in the northern districts farming cannot
be carried on successfully without a liberal supply being provided
for large as well as small stock. The grass country is, as a rule,
better supplied with water than any other part of the colony, the
average annual rainfall being over twenty-seven inches. There
are also numerous streams and springs which rarely fail even in
the most severe droughts.</p>

<p>The mixed grass and karroo country of the central districts is
especially adapted for Angora goat-farming, though at the same
time merino sheep are kept in large numbers. The pasture consists
mainly of sweet grasses, interspersed with karroo bushes of various
kinds, and dwarf trees, among which may be mentioned the Spekboom
(<i>Portulacaria afra Jacq</i>), a fleshy, round-leaved, soft-wooded
tree, which is a most valuable food for sheep, cattle, goats, and even
horses. The thornless species of the prickly pear (<i>Opuntia Tuna</i>)
is invaluable in seasons of drought; and both the wild thorn and
the mimosa tree furnish food of a nourishing and sustaining nature.
In the north and south-west, Angora goats do not thrive so well,
but in these localities merino sheep and Boer goats are kept in large
numbers.</p>

<p>Steek grass (<i>Aristida congesta R and S</i>) grows in many parts
of the mixed veldt, and is one of the greatest drawbacks to successful
farming. The seeds of this grass do not readily fall when
ripe, and are thus liable to be carried away by sheep and goats in
their fleeces. Many clips are seriously damaged by this seed, which
mats the hair and wool into hard solid masses, and often working
through the fleece pierces the skin, causing intense irritation, and in
some cases even death.</p>

<p>The rainfall varies considerably. In the north and central
districts the annual average is a little over sixteen inches, while in
the south-west it is almost twenty-four inches. As a rule the
former portion is but poorly watered, the farmers depending to a
large extent on springs and the artificial storage of water.</p>

<p>The karroo is well adapted for Angoras, as well as goats of the
common type. More than one-half the number of the Cape sheep in
the Colony is found in this region, which, owing to its vast extent and
low rainfall, is better suited for animals of an active and hardy nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>In the karroo the bushes are short and stunted, but they nevertheless
form most excellent grazing for small stock. When dry
seasons set in, the plants, although denuded of every green leaf,
retain nourishment for a remarkable period; and as long as water
is procurable, stock maintain their condition fairly well by feeding
on the bark and dry twigs. The most valuable bushes are: the
Draaibosch (<i>Diplopappus filifolius</i>); the Schaapbosch (<i>Penlzia
virgata</i>); the Gannabosch (<i>Caroxylon silsola</i>); and the Vygebosch
(<i>Mesembrianthemum spinosum</i>). When rain falls, the bushes shoot
into leaf, and in the course of two or three weeks, what appeared to
be a barren and parched wilderness, is transformed into beautiful and
highly nutritious pasturage.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;"><a name="illustration_48" id="illustration_48"></a>
<img src="images/illustration_48.png" width="419" height="313" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Angora Goats (Young Rams)</span>
</div>

<p>The karroo is badly watered, the farmers depending chiefly on
springs, wells, and dams for their supply. Underground water is
found at various depths, the average being about sixty feet. In but
few cases, however, does the supply rise to the surface, which
necessitates the use of windmills and pumps. The average annual
rainfall is over ten inches, though in some districts it does not
exceed six inches. Given good seasons, there is no part of
the Colony which is healthier for small stock than the karroo, and
there is certainly no portion in which sheep and goats multiply more
rapidly. One severe drought, however, will often sweep away the
increase of several years, and leave the farmer on the verge of ruin.</p>

<p>Throughout the Colony but few attempts are made to supply
winter feeding for stock, or to make adequate provision for times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
drought. Of late years the cultivation of lucerne has been on the
increase, and in the north and north-east, where the winters are long
and severe, turnips are grown, and these amply repay the farmers for
the labour and expense incurred.</p>

<p>The last reliable returns of the small stock in the Colony were
taken in the year 1898, since which date the disturbed state of the
country has prevented the collection of statistics of any value. At
the close of 1898 there were: 10,565,844 woolled sheep; 1,560,439
Cape or fat-tailed sheep; 3,039,482 Angora goats; and 2,312,052
common or Boer goats. These figures, especially as regards sheep,
will no doubt show a considerable decrease when the next census is
taken, for the demands of the military, and the losses incidental to
war, must to a certain extent have caused a marked reduction.</p>

<p>Merino sheep from the Royal flock of George III. were first
introduced at the Cape about the year 1793, but it was not until
1838 that any real progress in breeding was made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;"><a name="illustration_49" id="illustration_49"></a>
<img src="images/illustration_49.png" width="464" height="263" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption smcap">Fat-Tailed Hairy Africander Sheep (Rams)</span>
</div>

<p>Of late years Australian merinos, Tasmanian and Vermont
sheep have been largely imported; and there are many flocks in the
Colony which have been bred up to a very high standard. The
Vermont sheep, which are close, heavily-woolled animals, possess
many advantages, which, by judicious crossing, are well suited to
counteract some of the defects noticeable in the flocks of this
country. At the present time a very large proportion of the woolled
sheep are inferior in quality, and far below the standard of excellence
which every breeder of stock should strive to attain to.</p>

<p>The Cape or fat-tailed sheep is a leggy, active animal, with a
hairy skin, bred solely for the butcher. These sheep are noted
for their enormous tails, which weigh from ten to fifteen pounds,
although in some cases this last weight has been considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
exceeded. Being active and free from wool, the animal is peculiarly
adapted for the karroo, where long distances have generally to be
traversed in the search for pasture and water. The skin of the fat-tailed
sheep possesses a special value for glove-making, and good,
sound skins readily fetch fifty shillings per dozen, and as much as
seventy shillings when the quality can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>The Angora goat was first introduced into the Colony from
Asia Minor in 1838, and crossed with the common or Boer goat,
the progeny of which formed the nucleus of the Angora industry of
the present day. From time to time fresh importations have taken
place, the last consignment arriving in 1895-96. These goats, however,
proved disappointing, and although they realised high prices,
were distinctly inferior to the best goats bred in the Colony.</p>

<p>The Angora is a delicate animal, and as the shearing season
usually commences in the winter months, success in farming depends
in a great measure on the provision of suitable shelter, as a protection
against cold and wet weather.</p>

<p>The common or Boer goat is a large, well-made, active, and
hardy animal, which thrives in every part of the country; especially
in the dry and barren north-western districts. Large numbers of
these goats are sold to the butchers, the carcasses averaging from
sixty to sixty-five pounds in weight.</p>

<p>In many localities they are kept for their milking properties, on
which account they are extremely valuable, since they often supply
milk for household purposes when it would be impossible for horned
cattle to exist. Goat-skins are largely used for tanning, and supply
the farmer and his family with materials for their boots and veld
schoens.</p>

<p>Cape wool, as a rule, takes the lowest place on the principal
markets, and is the first to be effected by any downward tendency
in prices. There are several reasons for this unsatisfactory state of
affairs. These reasons have been brought prominently to the notice
of the colonial farmer, but, in spite of their importance and interest,
they have not as yet received the attention they deserve. Scab,
the greatest enemy that stock farmers have to contend with, is
prevalent in nearly every part of the country, and has proved so
destructive to the flocks and clips generally that the annual loss to
the country has been estimated at from five hundred thousand to
one million pounds sterling.</p>

<p>That this disease was a source of great trouble in the early days
at the Cape is very evident, for placcaats or edicts were framed, as far
back as 1693 and 1740, dealing most stringently with any man who
neglected the cleansing of his flocks. These placcaats, however,
in the course of time fell into desuetude, and it was not until 1886<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
that any serious attempt was made to cope with the disease. The
law passed at this time was only enforced in a small portion of the
Colony, but it proved of such service, that in 1894 another Act was
framed, which was proclaimed over the whole country. Owing to
certain defects in this legislation, the good results which were anticipated
have not been effected; but, nevertheless, some advance has
been made, as evidenced in the improved quality of the wool and
skins which leave these shores. Until more stringent measures for
the eradication of scab are introduced, the stigma attached to the
wool products of the Colony will not be removed.</p>

<p>In 1838 the quantity of wool exported was 490,754 lbs., valued at
£26,627. In 1891 the highest figures were reached, the record
being 75,520,701 lbs., of the value of £2,264,498: this in 1901 had
fallen to 65,209,699 lbs., valued at £1,489,246.</p>

<p>Mohair, the name given to the fleece of the Angora goat, is
peculiarly liable to variations in price, according to the fashions which
may be in vogue. On a well-bred animal the fleece should hang in
long wavy locks or ringlets of white, silky, lustrous hair; and when
full grown, should touch the ground. The fleeces vary in weight
according to the breed of the animal, and to the class to which it
belongs&mdash;oily or non-oily. From a well-bred flock of Angora ewes
the mohair should average about four pounds weight per animal.
In the case of rams and kapaters, or wethers, there is a considerable
increase, as much as from eight to fourteen pounds being sometimes
clipped. A dry climate is essential to the growth of good mohair, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
therefore the karroo and mixed grass and karroo country are admirably
adapted for its production. Almost all the Angoras in the Colony
are the progeny of rams imported from Asia Minor, crossed with the
white Boer goat; and it is probably owing to this fact that in many
flocks a considerable amount of kemp, or coarse white hair, is still to
be found. Even in the most favourable circumstances Cape mohair
realises less than the Turkish produce by from twopence to threepence
per pound; this probably being on account of the lack of
brightness and spinning properties possessed by the former article.</p>

<p>At the present time the Cape produces about one-half of the
world&#8217;s supply of mohair. In 1857 the quantity exported was 870 lbs.,
which realised £10. These figures in 1897 had increased to
12,583,601 lbs., valued at £676,644; and in 1901 had fallen to
10,813,239 lbs., of the value of £502,605. The decrease in the
exports of wool and mohair for the year 1901 is no doubt due to
the effects of the war and the disturbed state of the country.</p>

<p>At present, however, the outlook is more hopeful, and there is
no doubt whatever that for the progressive and enterprising farmer
the future is one of great possibilities.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By W. BLELOCH</span></p>

<p class="center small"><i>Author of &#8220;The New South Africa&#8221;</i></p>

<p>South Africa is a country of magnificent distances, with the
centres of industry situated at points far apart in the wide
interior; the country villages are dotted about with thirty
to fifty miles of brown karroo or verdant veldt in between;
even the homesteads of the Boers are planted at respectful
distances from each other. In such a country a comprehensive,
efficient, and cheap railway system is absolutely necessary; without
railways the development of trade and industry could not be pushed
forward on any large scale. The great staple products of the Cape&mdash;wool,
skins, and hides&mdash;could not compete with the like products
of Australia and the Argentine. The diamond mines of Kimberley,
which support an industrial population of about 50,000, and the
great gold mines of the Rand, which at the present stage of development
supply the wherewithal to live to 200,000 people, white and
black, would be able to work only on a restricted basis; the greater
number of the Rand mines would have to shut down, and without
railways it may be said that the stimulating production of wealth in
the nearly indestructible form of gold and diamonds would practically
cease.</p>

<p>To meet the requirements which the circumstances demand, a
far-stretching network of railways&mdash;with wide meshes it is true&mdash;is
growing over the country. Instead of the old system of ox
transport and coaches drawn by mules, which ten years ago were the
only means of approach to the Transvaal and Rhodesia, there are
now modern freight trains, drawn by heavy-type locomotives, hauling
up the vast import traffic to the Rand, and running down return
loads of wool and hides from the grassy uplands of the Orange
River Colony, and the barren-looking, but wide and productive,
karroo plains of the Cape. There are <i>trains de luxe</i> with corridors
and platforms to enable the passenger to stretch his limbs <i>en route</i>,
or sit in comfort and view the scenery as the train plods on its
twenty-five or thirty miles an hour.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago Bulawayo was the head kraal of a bloodthirsty
savage, and was approached only by a few adventurous
spirits who recked little of danger and less of time. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
journey from the coast to the inland centre took at least three
months, and now it can be visited with comfort and despatch.
Without alighting from the train the traveller can enjoy his
morning bath; he can breakfast, lunch, and dine; he can press a
button and call for cool, liquid refreshments at any hour of the
day; and he can complete his journey of 1360 miles from Cape Town
to the Rhodesian industrial capital in 3&frac12; days. The Cape Town-Johannesburg
journey of 1000 miles is done just within 44 hours.
These results may not be considered of much account by the
English or American traveller accustomed to a speed of 50 miles an
hour for long distances, but South African railways have been built
to suit the special necessities of the country. The gauge is only
3 feet 6 inches, and on all the lines heavy gradients have to be
negotiated.</p>

<p>The interior of South Africa is a great plateau elevated from 4000
to 6000 feet above sea-level. The edge of the plateau runs round
the sub-continent at no great distance from the sea, its bold escarpments
looking over the 50 to 100 miles of broken, low-lying coast lands
which skirt the continent. In consequence, all the railways to the
interior, within the first 100 miles from the coast, begin climbing up
steep inclines cut along the sides of one or other of the few passes
which admit of ascent by railway trains. Whether the journey is
made from Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, or
Delagoa Bay, the ascent has to be negotiated. The tedium of the
uphill journey is compensated to some extent by the grandeur of the
scenery in these initial stages of the routes to the interior. On
the Cape line there is the magnificent view of the Hex River which,
like Fair Melrose, can best be seen in pale moonlight as towards
morning the night train from Cape Town winds along, gradually
climbing up and up above the valley lying 1000 feet below. On
either side grand brown mountains rise like sentinels to guard
the pass. It has often been conjectured what would have been
the upshot if the Boers had marched right south and seized this
pass at the beginning of the war. It would have been Colenso
over again, only worse. On the Port Elizabeth line, from Coerney
to Cradock, the line passes up through rugged valleys in places
bright with the sub-tropical evergreen bush of South Africa,
and hemmed in with massive mountains forming the broken
edges of the continent. The line through Graaf Reinet negotiates
similar country, as does also the line from East London through
King William&#8217;s Town. The ascent from Durban is the most difficult
of all. Natal is formed almost wholly of great fragments of
the South African plateau which seem to have broken off, and
now lie in long lines of broken mountain chains running north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and south. These mountain ranges lie transverse to the route
of the railway, so that ascents and descents have to be made
time and again before the Transvaal high veldt is gained. From
Durban to Charlestown the aggregate ascent is 12,600 feet.
Altitudes of two, three, four, and five thousand feet are gained
<i>en route</i> and then partially lost again. Some of the scenery
on this line is of surpassing interest and beauty. Near the
coast there are fruit gardens, pine and banana plantations, and
orange groves, with here and there fields of pasture fenced in.
Farther up, mealie fields spread along the slopes of the hills
and down the valleys. Then there follow stretches of open
grass country alternating with bush. Herds of cattle, fat and
sleek, graze on the rich grass lands. Above Pietermaritzburg
the line ascends for three thousand feet to highlands to descend
again two thousand to Colenso.</p>

<span class="caption smcap">Bridge over the Tugela, Zululand Extension (1330 Feet Long)
Connecting Natal and Zululand</span>
</div>

<p>The next stretch of fifty miles has become one of the historic
districts of the empire. In a winding of the Tugela lies Colenso.
Then Pieters Hill is climbed, and the traveller can realise the
desperate nature of the task set to General Buller&#8217;s army. Then
come Wagon Hill and Cæsar&#8217;s Camp, with Bulwan on the right and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Ladysmith lying in a hollow in the centre. Beyond Ladysmith the
train climbs again to Elandslaagte, and begins in a succession of
gradual ascents to climb to the crest of the Drakensberg, the final
climb being made under the shadow of Majuba, and through the
tunnel of Laing&#8217;s Nek. Once at Charlestown the high veldt is
gained for good. The ascent from Delagoa Bay is easier, in that
there is not the same repetition of ups and downs as on the Natal
railway. The line runs through the Komati Poort, and then up the
Elands River Valley, a beautiful valley indeed, but a veritable valley
of death to the builders of the railway. At Waterval Onder the
final steep ascent is begun, part of the way being so steep that the
cog-wheel system is required. At Waterval Boven the high veldt is
gained, and the main difficulties left behind.</p>

<p>The Beira railway to Salisbury has a similar ascent to make.
Having described the approaches, some idea may now be given of
the railway routes on the interior plateau itself. The Cape Town
line to De Aar and Kimberley after gaining the plateau traverses
the Great Karroo, a monotonous stretch of several hundred miles of
parched brown, barren-looking plain with isolated, flat-topped mountains,
and ranges which serve to give variety, and make a scene of
widespread solitude, having a melancholy charm wholly its own.
This barren-looking veldt, with its sparse vegetation of stunted
shrubs, supports millions of sheep and goats, and however unpromising
its aspect, it plays an important part in the railway and
general economy of the country. The Midlands railway from Port
Elizabeth to De Aar and Norval&#8217;s Pont traverses similar country, but
not so arid. The Eastern railway, from East London through King
William&#8217;s Town and Queenstown to Bethulie, traverses more undulating
country covered with grass intermixed with karroo shrub. In
some districts, notably round King William&#8217;s Town and Queenstown,
agriculture has made considerable headway. The western line continues
from Kimberley through Vryburg (British Bechuanaland) to
Mafeking, and on to Bulawayo through grass-covered country, with
clumps of Kameeldoorn trees, presenting in many places the appearance
of an English park. This is a great cattle country, and provides
considerable traffic for the railway over and above the mining
traffic of Kimberley and Rhodesia. All the Cape lines connect with
one another with two necks which converge at Springfontein for the
Orange River Colony and Transvaal traffic. From the Orange
River northwards the railways are known as the Central South
African Railways. The line through the Orange River Colony runs
through flat grassy plains for a distance of 300 miles: plains
which, after a devastating war, still hold over a million sheep and
160,000 head of cattle. In time of peace the whole country is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
monotonous scene of pastoral prosperity. On entering the Transvaal
at Vereeniging&mdash;the place of the declaration of peace&mdash;the
railway enters at once into the rich gold-bearing region of the
Transvaal. There is a gradual rise over open country to the Rand.
On every side there is evidence of great industrial activity, and at
many places along the line beginnings may be seen of Transvaal
agriculture, beginnings which promise a great future.</p>

<p>The south-eastern branch of the Central South African Railways
connects with the Natal line at Volksrust, and proceeds along the
high veldt viâ Standerton and Heidelberg to the Rand. The high
veldt of the Transvaal has an average height of 5000 feet above sea-level.
It is a vast open grass country with rocky ridges rising a
few hundred feet above the ordinary level. A magnificent stock
country, and rich in coal, iron, and gold. On the eastern line, the
Central South African line connects with the Portuguese line at
Komati Poort, and passes up the Elands River Valley already described.
From Waterval Boven the railway continues to ascend to
the summit of the high veldt at Bergendal, near Belfast. It was here
where the last big pitched battle was fought before the break-up of
the Boer army into guerilla forces. The line passes along the
northern limits of the high veldt <i>viâ</i> Middelburg to Pretoria. The
country it passes through is equal in stock-raising capabilities and
mineral riches to the south-eastern line. There are enormous areas
of coal of good quality and abundance of iron ore, and limestone
sufficient for the establishment of a great industry which itself will
doubtless bring about and maintain great railway expansion in the
future.</p>

<p>From Pretoria, the Pretoria-Pietersburg line, formerly a private
company, now taken over by the Central South African Railways,
strikes north to Pietersburg into the heart of the tropical part of the
Transvaal. The country it traverses is partly flat and partly hilly,
at some places thick bush and at others wide grassy plains. In the
northern district there is a large population of Kaffirs who cultivate
the extremely fertile soil, and produce great quantities of mealies
(maize) and Kaffir corn, which products, together with timber for
the mines, form the principal items of traffic carried by the railway.
The Beira railway to Salisbury, originally a narrow gauge, has now
been widened to the standard 3 feet 6 inches gauge of South Africa,
and carries all the traffic for the Mashonaland mines.</p>

<p>In all, South Africa possesses approximately 5000 miles of railway,
having a capitalised value, including rolling stock, of about
£50,000,000, or £10,000 per mile. The three important systems
are the Cape Government Railways, the Natal Government Railways,
and the Central South African Railways (Transvaal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Orange River Colony). The Cape system has a mileage of 2135
miles, and in addition it works 587 miles of the Rhodesian Railways,
or a total of 2722 miles. The Natal system covers 612&frac12; miles,
and the Central South African system 1312 miles. In addition
to these there is the Beira Railway, already briefly described, and
there are also several small privately-owned railways. The three
chief systems own altogether 1239 engines and 27,806 waggons,
and a large but still insufficient equipment of coaches for passenger
traffic. Great attention has been given and much money
expended in the past two years in bringing the rolling stock up
to a state of efficiency for dealing with the greatly-increased traffic
anticipated on the establishment of peace in South Africa. The
Central South African Railways&mdash;the State Railways now owning
and working the old Free State and Netherlands systems&mdash;have
almost doubled the carrying capacity of these railways. Natal had
129 engines before the war; she has now 209. She had 3101 waggons
before the war; she has now 6154. The Cape railways have
also largely increased their stock. The enormous traffic now being
handled, more or less successfully, will justify this provident policy.</p>

<p>All these systems make large annual profits. In its best year,
1896, the Cape Government system showed&mdash;</p>

Railways, formerly the Imperial Military Railways, during the
period of the war. Nor are there any available now, but considering
the past results and the great volume of present traffic, and
the maintenance of the old high rates for freight and passenger
fares, it may be estimated that the earnings of the Central South
African Railways in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony
will probably be between £5,500,000 and £6,000,000, and the profits
between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000, a very important item in the
revenues of the two new colonies.</p>

<p>These figures show that South African railways make high
earnings as compared even with a great railway like the Canadian
Pacific, a railway serving one of the most important trade routes in
the world, and traversing a rich agricultural country, with a population
of 5,000,000, as compared with South Africa&#8217;s 700,000 whites
and 2,000,000 blacks. The Queensland railways, with more than
half the mileage, earn less than one-eighth the total earned by
South African railways, while the enormous traffic of the famous
London North-Western, with its large capitalised value, only
brings in a matter of £3,000,000 a year more than the railways
of South Africa, with their moderate capitalisation of £50,000,000.</p>

<p>This comparison should bring home to investors the excellent
opening which South Africa affords for safe and profitable participation
in the reasonable railway expansion the country still requires,
especially is this the case with the two new colonies. Another
fifteen hundred miles could well be added. These new railways
would have earning capacity little inferior to the existing lines, and
the present margin of profits is so wide that a substantial reduction
in rates would not materially affect the prospects, because such a
reduction would inevitably result in a great increase in the volume
of traffic.</p>

<p>The comparison also leads to the conclusion that the present
rates are excessive. They have been maintained at their high level
through the system of the Colonial Governments looking to the
railways for a large proportion of the revenue. The great pivot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
South African industry is the Rand, with its goldfields, and both
Natal and Cape Colony have for years past taken toll on the Rand
traffic, and thereby swelled their own revenues.</p>

<p>The old Free State and Transvaal Governments in a like
manner determined to fleece the industrial workers, and so save
their own burghers from bearing their due share of the cost of
Government. While they were the greatest sinners themselves,
they could not with reason ask the southern Governments to take
the first step towards moderation. As a consequence, the Rand,
dependent for the most part of its food and for the whole of its
industrial equipment on over-sea supplies, became one of the most
expensive places to live and work in that the wide world knows.
Under the new <i>regime</i> there is as yet no improvement; the Imperial
Government is looking for revenue. To the despair of British
loyalists the old high rates are maintained, with the effect of
delaying and perhaps prohibiting the enormous industrial progress
which the wealth of the country would under other conditions make
possible. All classes feel the burden, and at the forthcoming Congress
of the Associated Chamber of Commerce, which will meet at
Kimberley, resolutions bearing on the question are to be submitted.
The first affirms: &#8220;That the railways, being the highways of the
country, should be worked solely with a view to furnishing the
transit and traffic requirements of the country, and entirely dissociated
from the revenual, political, or protective considerations;&#8221;
and &#8220;That the policy of raising revenue through excessive railway
rates is an objectionable method of taxation. It is unfair in its
incidence, and bears with especial hardship on the inland wage-earner.&#8221;</p>

<p>These resolutions reflect the feelings of the whole inland community
of South Africa.</p>

£5,000,000 on a similar capital. The Canadian Pacific Railway
makes a net profit of £371 per mile against a net profit of Natal
railways of £803 per mile, and an approximate net profit of £1800
per mile of the Central South African railways (Transvaal and
Orange River Colony railways). New Zealand railway returns for
1902 show net earning of £280 per mile. The through rate for
ordinary goods from Durban to Johannesburg is just over 3&frac34;d. per
ton per mile. The rate for ordinary goods on the Central South
African railways (Transvaal railways) for fifteen miles is 9d. per ton
per mile; for fifty miles, 6&#x2154;d. per ton per mile; for longer distances,
approximately 6d. per ton per mile. The average rate for goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
on the Canadian Pacific Railway is only one-third of a penny per
ton per mile. Were this rate charged on a ton of goods brought
from Durban&mdash;the nearest colonial port&mdash;to Johannesburg, the cost
would be only 13s. 6d. as against £7, 13s. 4d., the present cost; that
is, the South African through rate is ten times as much as the
average rate in Canada; and the Transvaal rate for ordinary local
traffic of 6d. to 9d. per ton per mile is twenty times higher than the
average Canadian rate. The Canadian Pacific Railway is selected
for comparison, because it is a railway built to develop new and
sparsely-populated territory, its special work being essentially the
same as that required of the railways of South Africa. The
Canadian Pacific Railway has doubled its earnings since 1895. If
its policy were copied in South Africa, where the whole industrial
life of the country depends on railways, enormous developments
could be looked for. In South Africa it is fully realised that, until
the burden of excessive railway rates is got rid of, the costs of living
must prohibit any great growth of population, and without growth
of population the development of the natural resources of the country
can only make the slowest of progress. The people are quite
willing to provide the Government with revenue, but they wish to
provide it by different methods than those which obtained in the past.</p>

<p>Owing to exorbitant fares the people of Johannesburg are
practically confined within the limits of the town and its immediate
suburbs. They are compelled to pay high rents. £250 to £300 a
year represents the present rent for an ordinary cottage. The
passenger fares on the London and North-Western are from a 1&frac12;d.
to 1&frac34;d. per mile first, 1&frac14;d. second, and fractionally under a 1d. third.
A great reduction is made on season tickets. Transvaal railway
fares average 3d. per mile first, 2&frac12;d. second, and 1&frac12;d. third, and only
a small reduction is made for season tickets. With high rents
and high prices for food, rendered dear by cost of carriage, the
workers, in order to live, must obtain high wages. High wages
mean high-working costs for all industrial enterprises. Consequently
only a few industries, and only the richer mines, can be
worked at a profit. Ordinary industries which can carry only
moderate working costs cannot be undertaken.</p>

<p>Judging from the results of the past six years sweeping reductions
are quite possible while still allowing for a paying railway revenue.
Mr. Cooper-Key has shown, that the excess profits made by the
Transvaal railways alone, after providing for reasonable interest on
capital at the rate of 4&frac34; per cent., were:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Transvaal railway profits by year" class="bc">

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></p>

<p>For the present year the excess profits on Transvaal railways, over
a 4 per cent. interest on capital, will probably amount to not far
short of £1,500,000.</p>

<p>As might be expected after a consideration of the profits and
earning capacity of South African railways, important extensions of
the previous system are projected and in progress.</p>

<p>In the Cape Colony there is a project to connect Saldanha
Bay, the proposed new port, with the main line <i>viâ</i> Hopefield. A
southern line <i>viâ</i> Oudtshoorn and Willowmore will bring Cape Town
in closer contact with Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth, and open up
the southern districts of Cape Colony. Another line will join
the Port Elizabeth midland line with the eastern system at King
Williamstown.</p>

<p>In the Orange River Colony the projected lines are from
Springfontein to Koffyfontein; from Bloemfontein to Ladybrand
and Ficksburg; from Harrismith to Heilbron or Vereeniging. The
line from Bloemfontein to Ladybrand is already partly built. It
will open up the wheat-growing section of the Orange River
Colony.</p>

<p>In the Transvaal the most important projected lines are: A line
from Fourteen Streams to Klerksdorp, providing an alternative
route from the Cape Ports to the Rand. A line from Krugersdorp
to Rustenburg and thence probably to Zeerust and Mafeking,
opening up a valuable agricultural country. A line from Springs to
Machadodorp or Ermelo, through the best coal and iron districts of
the Transvaal, and providing an alternative route from Delagoa Bay
to the Rand. This line would greatly relieve the congestion which
exists after the high veldt is gained on the present eastern line, owing
to the coal traffic and the over-sea imports having to be carried
over a single line of railway. A line from Pietersburg to Leydsdorp
and thence probably connecting with the Selati railway at its present
terminus. There is a private company formed to build a line from
Machadodorp to Ermelo, and the Government is constructing a coal
line for the mines along the south of the Rand, and another alternative
line from Johannesburg to Vereeniging.</p>

<p>In Natal it is a question of doubling the present main line or of
constructing another single line of railway from Greytown to the
Transvaal. The first plan would be cheaper, and would give more
immediate help to Natal in the competition for Transvaal traffic,
while the alternative Greytown route would open up new country
to railway influence, and materially add to the prosperity of the
agricultural population of that section of the colony. Natal is also
about to construct a line from Maritzburg to Riverside on the Cape-Natal
frontier. The Cape being under promise to connect this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
point with their eastern system, and thus provide direct railway
communication with Durban and Cape Town.</p>

<p>In Rhodesia the line connecting Bulawayo and Salisbury is
approaching completion.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is possible that Gwelo, a town on the
railway, will be the junction or next starting-point of the &#8220;Cape to
Cairo&#8221; railway, or it may be that the route by another new line
from Bulawayo to the Wankie coalfields near the Zambesi may be
chosen instead. A line is in course of construction from Bulawayo
to the Gwanda goldfields, and a line is proposed from Salisbury
north to Lo Maghonda. Altogether over 2000 miles of new
railway are projected in South Africa. In the Transvaal the new
lines proposed will have a length of over 800 miles, and at least 500
miles may be considered as lines whose construction is a matter of
urgent necessity.</p>

<p>This forecast of railway development in the immediate future in
South Africa means the raising and spending of another £16,000,000,
£8000 per mile being about the lowest figure that can be reckoned
on to build the lines and provide rolling stock. Transvaal expenditure
for new railways may be estimated for the period of the
next three years at not less than £6,000,000. When built, however,
these railways will be sound properties, thoroughly sure as to their
dividend or interest-earning capacity. Lord Milner referred in a
recent speech to what he called the governmental plant which he
said was required before private enterprise could get to work on
making the country productive. Chief among the governmental
plant so referred to are railways, but alongside of the recognition
of the necessity of railways it is to be hoped that governmental
recognition will also be given to the fact that to be of real use the
railways must be run at cheap rates, otherwise the looked-for benefit
will never come.</p>

<p>As regards over-sea traffic, it is hoped that rates may be brought
down by encouraging competition between the various railways from
the coast, and the Transvaal Government has a powerful lever in its
eastern line. The distance from Delagoa Bay to the Rand is only
395 miles, of which only 56 belong to the Portuguese.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Durban the distance is 483 miles; from Port Elizabeth, 785
miles, and from Cape Town, 1000 miles. The Transvaal Government
has the whip in hand, and it is hoped that it will use it so that all
South Africa will be brought into line on the question of moderate
freight and passenger rates. At present goods are pouring into the
Transvaal at the rate of 21,000 tons per week, and in addition there
are 8000 tons being brought up weekly for the military, but if rates
are not lowered, this great railway activity will prove only transient,
because it is certain that at present the internal industries are
making no progress, and consequently trade must fall off.</p>

</div>

<p>In conclusion, a word may be said of the important part played
by South African railways in the late war. A German strategist
predicted that with the existing railway systems of South Africa it
would be impossible to feed an army of 250,000 men in the interior
of the country. Yet it was actually done, and not for a brief period
only, but for nearly three years. Besides bringing the food-stuff
for this host, and for the civil population besides, the railways transported
guns, ammunition, horses and men up and down, back and
forward as the commander-in-chief required. The magnitude of
this work can be imagined when it is stated that no less than 126
trains were required for the final concentration against Delarey at
Klerksdorp. The working of the railways during the war reflects
the greatest credit on the managers and employées of all South
African railways. It was impossible to tell when a train would run
through a band of snipers, one or more of its occupants paying the
penalty of death, or when the engine might be hoisted by a hidden
charge of dynamite, and the machine and its drivers turned to
wreckage. During the war the railway service required qualities of
endurance and courage equal to those possessed by the bravest
soldier in the field.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">SOUTH AFRICAN INDUSTRIES</h3>

<p>At present South African industries (outside of agriculture and
pastoral pursuits) may be said to consist of mining and railways.
The railways, in spite of heavy rates, have made a great mining industry
possible. What could they do in respect of other and ordinary
industries? It is a question of rates. Given recognition of
the principle that railways should be the most essential part of the
governmental plant spoken of by Lord Milner&mdash;plainly to be used
for developing the country, and not for the use of extracting revenue
to which it is at present put, not gold-mining alone, but a hundred
industries would presently flourish. On the Rand there are already
great engineering works contending against many difficulties, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
especially the cost of labour. These works execute repairs for the
mines, make castings, and even manufacture new machinery. A
great future industry, which for the present is impossible on account
of want of railway facilities, is the exploitation of the rich iron ores of
the Transvaal. It is stated that a syndicate with large capital has
been formed to undertake this work on a large scale when the conditions
are favourable, and within the next few years it is probable
that the Middelburg district will have smelting furnaces, foundries,
rolling mills, and all the varied works of a young iron and steel
industry which may eventually take a leading place in the world.
Mr. Carnegie recently stated that the iron ores of Britain will be
exhausted in twenty-five years, and those of the United States in
sixty years. The extensive deposits of the Transvaal should last
for centuries.</p>

<p>Another possible future industry is the distillation of oil from
the shales of the Eastern Transvaal and the Orange River Colony.
These deposits are at present being tested, and give promise of
payability. Throughout South Africa there are many flour mills.
The chief works being at Port Elizabeth and Cape Town and in
the wheat district of the Orange River Colony. Other industries
which have found a footing, and are now making steady progress,
are leather-making, boot and harness making, wool-washing, jam-making,
candle-making, waggon and cart building from colonial
woods. All these industries are carried on chiefly in the Cape
Colony and Natal. In the Transvaal there are pottery works, a
cement factory, many breweries, and one distillery. In the Cape
and Natal there are also several large breweries. One great industry
which has arisen, owing to the mining wealth of the country,
is the manufacture of explosives. There is a large dynamite factory
at Cape Town owned by the De Beers Company, and another&mdash;the
largest explosive factory in the world&mdash;at Modderfontein near
Johannesburg. The Modderfontein factory cost upwards of three-quarters
of a million to build. The works are spread over a large
area, the property comprising 5280 acres. This factory was owned
by a company with German, English, and French interests, formed
to work the dynamite monopoly for the Transvaal Government.
The high prices it charged, and the huge profits it made, being
additional direct burdens on the already overloaded mining industry,
were the causes of great discontent. Since the war the monopoly
has been abolished. The company is now practically a British
company, and its policy appears to be to meet its customers, and
gain their goodwill. Prices have been reduced by 30s. a case
The prices now being: blasting gelatine, 67s. 6d.; gelignite, 50s.;
and dynamite, 50s. a case, as against 97s. 6d., 87s. 6d., and 77s. 6d.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
respectively before the war. These prices are fair, and it is stated
are just sufficient to give a margin of profit. At present in the
Transvaal it is a question of allowing free competition in explosives,
or of just granting sufficient protection to the existing factory to
enable it to live. As the factory finds employment for nearly 3000
hands, white and black, it would certainly be a national loss if it had
to shut down.</p>

<p>In the nature of things in South Africa all classes of industrial
undertakings are difficult to establish, and probably a moderate
protective tariff would be beneficial to the country in the long run,
as in the initial stages it would serve to turn the balance between
profit and loss. Every industry successfully established adds to the
white population, and is therefore to be welcomed. A policy of
moderate protection then for industries, which could be fed by the
natural resources of the country itself, should be carefully considered
by the Government. Such a policy, together with a thorough cutting
down of the present industry-killing railway rates, would go a
long way to make a speedy beginning in South Africa of the great
industrial activity which is sure to come eventually.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By ERNEST GRAHAM LITTLE</span></p>

<p class="center small"><i>B.A., formerly Porter Scholar, of the Cape University; M.D. University of London; Member of the
Royal College of Physicians; Physician, with charge of the Skin Department, at St. Mary&#8217;s
Hospital; Senior Assistant Physician to the East London Hospital for Children and
Dispensary for Women, Shadwell; late House Physician at St. George&#8217;s
Hospital and at the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest</i></p>

<p>In these days, when the physical methods of treating disease
are so largely supplementing, and even supplanting, the
methods of what may be termed chemical therapeutics, the
question of suitable health resorts is one which must engage
the attention of every medical man who is anxious to do his
best for his patient. The opening up of South Africa by the
success of British arms will be followed shortly, it is to be hoped,
by a vigorous development of the country through colonisation
and the investment of capital. Thus will be afforded a new and
more extended field for the employment of the natural therapeutics
of climate, soil, and environment, by which to combat the advance
of many insidious diseases. We English people are too prone to
bend the knee to foreign Baals, who but mock us as we worship.
It should be an additional pleasure to every enlightened Imperialist
to think that within the borders of our own empire, in lands peopled
by those who speak our own kindly mother-tongue, we may find physical
conditions in every way superior to those of foreign health-resorts,
which have hitherto waxed fat and become insolent in their fancied
monopoly. I write with the hope that many who are ignorant of
these superior advantages possessed by South Africa may be guided
by these pages to make their choice of a recreation-ground more
intelligently, and consequently with better results, than is at present
usually the case. It is true that at the moment invalids should be
dissuaded from going to South Africa while the difficulties exist of
transport and maintenance of so large and so sudden an increase of
population. Supposing that our railway companies had not been able
to run any extra trains for the last Coronation procession in London,
we should have had a picture of congestion and discomfort not
unlike what is happening in South Africa at the present time. But
these difficulties are but of the moment and are passing hourly.
When once things have settled down a little, normal methods will
prevail; and it may confidently be predicted that travelling in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Africa will become increasingly comfortable and easy as the flow of
population and wealth create a demand for increased facilities.
Already far nearer approximation to our standards of comfort has
been made than is dreamt of by stay-at-home Englishmen. The
ox-waggon is not now the usual means of covering the distance
between Wynberg and Kimberley, as was apparently thought by a
medical lecturer not many years ago, since he gravely advised his
audience to adopt that method of transit. We have only within the
last few months seen in London electric trams as good as those that
have been running for some years from Cape Town to Sea Point.</p>

<p>The voyage to South Africa is one of the pleasantest and most
healthful in the world. It is in itself a powerful factor in the restoration
of mind and body. There are two routes by which one can
travel, the East and the West Coast routes. The East Coast route,
by which Mr. Chamberlain travelled, is of recent development, and
the principal steamers running on it are German (the German
East Africa Company). Passengers may join the boat at Hamburg,
Antwerp, Marseilles, or Naples, and the voyage is broken
at Port Said, Suez, Aden, Zanzibar, Delagoa, and is terminated
at Durban. It is thus an interesting itinerary, and for
those who fear sea-sickness may be recommended, as the vessel is
never longer than five days continuously at sea. The pleasantest
months in which to travel by this route are February, March, and
April. At other times it is apt to be oppressively hot. The
personnel of the fleet is very obliging and anxious to promote the
comfort of passengers, but the German cooking is not to the taste of
all English palates. The steamers carry a German medical officer.
The time occupied is about six weeks, and the fares are from £48 for
first-class, from £33 for second, and from £21 for third. The West
Coast service is at present practically a monopoly of the Union-Castle
Company, formed by the amalgamation of the Union and Castle
lines, which formerly competed for the passenger traffic. The time
occupied by this service, which carries the royal mails, is much
shorter, being usually about sixteen days. The fares range from
35 guineas for first, from 23 guineas for second, and from 10 guineas
for third class. The voyage is exceedingly pleasant at any time of
the year, and but little rough weather is met with, the worst part of
the buffeting being often in the English Channel and Bay of Biscay.
After leaving Madeira, which is about four days out from England,
the sea is usually smooth and the weather gloriously fine. The
feeding and accommodation on these steamers are comparable with
those of a European first-class hotel, and all of them carry a well-qualified
medical man. Latterly, some competition with these lines
has been introduced, and is to be welcomed. Messrs. Bucknall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Brothers, Messrs. Rennie, the White Star Company, the German
East Africa line, the Shaw-Savill Company, and others are now
running frequent steamers to the Cape and Natal, and their fares
are lower than those of the Union-Castle line, and the comfort
and speed are not much less than obtain with this service. Where,
however, time and not money is the important consideration, the
Union-Castle steamers must be preferred. These steamers start
from London and Southampton, and call at Madeira, Teneriffe,
Grand Canary, and St. Helena (not more than two of these places
on each voyage). The steamers remain three or four days at Cape
Town, and proceed up the east coast, calling at Port Elizabeth, East
London, and finally Durban, which is the end of the voyage.</p>

<p>For many cases of nervous break-down, so common a feature of
our over-strained civilisation, I regard the Cape trip as an invaluable
restorative. Persons who have had a severe attack of influenza
would regain their strength more surely in a holiday spent in going
and returning from the Cape than in any other way. I particularise
influenza for its frequency, but the benefit is equally great in many
other affections in which the nervous system especially suffers.
Thus I have seen extraordinarily good results follow in a case of
persistent insomnia of many months&#8217; duration. The patient completely
conquered his sleeplessness during the voyage out, and was
perfectly free from it on his return, and has remained exempt for
years. In another instance a gentleman whose symptoms pointed to
the early nervous break-down of general paralysis, recovered his faculties
of mental concentration and memory as a result of a visit of a few
weeks&#8217; duration. In the case of phthisical patients, whose special
desiderata I shall discuss throughout this paper, it would be well
for the companies to arrange, where possible, for facilities for their
sleeping under cover on deck, in order to avoid the unavoidable
closeness of cabins during the night. This would be a matter of no
difficulty or discomfort for three-quarters of the voyage. The wants
of delicate infants are met by the carriage in most of the mail steamers
of a cow, so that fresh milk can be obtained throughout the voyage;
but a store of milk, adequately sterilised before leaving England,
may with advantage be taken with them by anxious mothers to
ensure proper supplies for their infants. The milk keeps perfectly,
and a couple of dozen pint-bottles will last out the voyage, and be
a security against lacking this essential nourishment.</p>

<p>The ports of arrival in South Africa are usually Durban for the
East Coast routes and Cape Town for the West Coast. The health-characteristics
of these ports will be discussed after a general survey
of the climatic conditions of the country has been made.</p>

<p>It is a common mistake to send patients to South Africa with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
detailed instructions as to the localities best suited for individual
cases, and regardless of the fact that the physiography of the
country is so varied that no general statement as to the climate is
possible. Two broad features, however, may be immediately distinguished,
if we regard South Africa as consisting of interior highlands
surrounded by a narrow, low-lying coast belt, the width of the
latter varying much, but seldom exceeding fifty miles. The largest
towns, with the exception of Johannesburg, are comprised in the
coast-belt, the uplands being for the most part sparsely inhabited.
The climate of the seaboard is further conditioned by the prevalence
of currents and winds, so that towns on the east coast have a
materially different atmosphere from those of the west. It will, of
course, be remembered that the seasons in the southern hemisphere
are exactly reversed with respect to those of the northern. For the
Cape the division of the year may be made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="nosymbol">
<li><i>Spring</i>&mdash;September, October, November.</li>
<li><i>Summer</i>&mdash;December, January, February.</li>
<li><i>Autumn</i>&mdash;March, April, May.</li>
<li><i>Winter</i>&mdash;June, July, August.</li>
</ul>

<p>In South Africa, however, the matter is complicated by the fact
that the rains occur, in some parts, mostly in the winter, as in England
and northern countries generally, and in other parts are strictly confined
to the summer. The humidity of the air is probably the most
important factor in the healthiness or otherwise of a climate for many
diseases, and this point must therefore be most carefully considered.
For phthisis in particular moist warmth has long been condemned
as only less harmful than moist cold. Madeira and the Riviera
have consequently lost much of their former vogue as suitable
resorts for phthisis, on account of their high degree of humidity.
It is to be earnestly desired that the claims of the highlands of
South Africa to be considered the most advantageous country in the
world for all but the latest stages of this disease, should become more
widely known, alike to patients and physicians. A further consideration,
of the highest importance to non-wealthy consumptives, is that
South Africa is a new and progressive country, in which there are
good prospects that the change of environment will lead, not only to
restored health, but to the means of earning a livelihood as well.</p>

<p>It will be necessary now to examine more in detail the special
characteristics of the several regions of South Africa and their
relative fitness for receiving patients and visitors. Besides the question
of climate many other factors must be considered, such as the
accommodation for invalids, the possibility of obtaining comfort and
suitable food, and the social conditions which form, from a psychological
standpoint, an important element in the treatment. To take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the last point first, I would earnestly deprecate the focal accumulation
of a large number of invalids, especially of tubercular invalids,
in one centre; not so much because of the infectivity of such an
accumulation, but because of the deplorable mental depression
which results from the constant contemplation of other sufferers from
this disease. Any one who has had experience of large hospitals
or sanatoria for phthisis must have been struck with the undesirability,
from this point of view, of the aggregation of patients.
Mind and body are so inextricably mingled that the intelligent
physician will attach not less importance to factors concerning the
first than to those affecting the second. Let the sick man, therefore,
avoid his sick fellows, when this is possible, and mix by
preference with the healthy and robust. Health, like ill-health, is
contagious. But when the patient&#8217;s forces are too far shattered to
allow of this, sanatoria become necessary. I contend still that these
should be small and disseminated, rather than central and on a colossal
scale. This subject will be discussed in greater detail later.</p>

<p>Accommodation and the obtaining of creature comforts for
invalids are, of course, more practicable in the towns than in
the sparsely-populated country districts, but, unhappily, the towns
are mostly confined to the coast-belt, which is not the healthiest
part of South Africa. The variations of climate within this coast-belt
are great, and are influenced, as has been said, by the prevalence
of winds and rains, and sea-currents. The eastern and south-eastern
parts of the seaboard have heavy summer rains; the
southern and south-western parts have in the first a rainfall
somewhat evenly distributed through the year, with winter rains
as one approaches the west. The imaginary approximate line
between the summer and winter rains would divide the southern
coast in the longitude of Grahamstown. West of this line the
rainfall may be said to vary between ten and twenty-five inches;
east of this line it is uniformly above the latter figure. The mean
humidity of the coast-line is about 75 per cent. It may be
said at once that for this reason none of the coast districts, as
regards climate, is an advantageous resort for all-the-year-round
residence for phthisical patients, but that the seaboard having
winter rains is <i>ipso facto</i> less suitable than that in which the
rainfall is chiefly in the summer months. It is unfortunate that
hitherto many circumstances have conspired to make the English
visitor in search of health reluctant to live out of the towns, though
these are often by no means the most suitable places for him.
Political dissension between the two great occupying races has been
the bane of South Africa and especially of the Cape Colony. It has
come about that the progressive English have settled in the towns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
while the unprogressive Dutch have kept tenaciously to the country.
As a corollary from this, it is still the reproach of South Africa that,
outside of a few towns, it is impossible to obtain good accommodation
for the traveller, and still less for the invalid. It is earnestly
to be hoped that the wider knowledge of the country, consequent
upon the attention which has been concentrated upon it during the
war, will lead to a large immigration of settlers who, eschewing the
goldfields, will be content with the securer, if less considerable,
competence to be obtained from agriculture, and will thus develop
the country. It was a very wise and far-seeing plan of the late
Mr. Rhodes to settle energetic English farmers in the midst of a
stagnant Dutch district, and it is desirable in every way to break up
the hard-and-fast racial division which has made so permanent an
impress on the land. But this must be a matter of time, and for
many years it must remain true that in the precious search for health
the English invalid must be content to live in the midst of an alien
majority, sometimes bitterly antipathetic to all things English. An
even more important reason for keeping to the towns is that owing
to the devastation of cattle caused by rinderpest and red-water, food,
especially fresh meat, milk, and butter, has become dear and difficult
to procure. To sum up, it may therefore be said that to the
seriously ill, who are incapable of roughing it in any sense, the coast
lands, though as regards climate not so satisfactory as the upper
plateaux, are the only possible resource; but the sick man who is
not yet so sick as to be laid up, is urged to quit the coast as soon as
possible, and to take up his abode in the higher plains.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">HEALTH RESORTS IN THE COAST-BELT</h3>

<p>Cape Town, the capital of the Cape Colony, is the usual terminus
of the voyage from England. It lies at the foot of Table Mountain,
on the shores of Table Bay. Though an ugly town, it has natural
surroundings of great beauty, and its suburbs are picturesque in the
extreme. It has an excellent water-supply derived from Table
Mountain, but its drainage is bad and the death-rate excessively
high for a position of such natural advantage. Living is dear and at
the present time exorbitant, owing to the large influx of persons
wishing to go up to the goldfields, and unable to proceed on their
way by reason of the congestion of the railway and the impossibility
of finding house-room at their ultimate destination. The hotels are
for the most part expensive, and leave much to be desired as regards
cleanliness and comfort to the traveller fresh from Europe. There
are numerous boarding-houses which are often comfortable and well
managed, and in which the charges are about £12 per month for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
each person. The city itself, however, is not a pleasant place to live
in, and most of the business community have houses in the suburbs,
retaining only offices and shops in the town. The pleasantest residential
district within the metropolis itself is the part called &#8220;the
Gardens,&#8221; at the top of Government Avenue, a fine shady walk not
open to wheeled traffic, with a double row of oak trees on each side,
some of them planted by Governor Van der Stell, between 1679
and 1699. The magnificent Parliament buildings, Government
House (the residence of the High Commissioner), many of the
Government offices, the Public Library and Museum, the South
African College, are all in close proximity to this part of the town.
The library contains the most notable collection of books to be
found in any of our colonies, including, as it does, the great Grey
collection and the Dessinian bequest. It is particularly rich in
literature dealing with South African history.</p>

<p>There is a large native quarter where the Malays congregate.
It is overcrowded and insanitary to a degree, and contributes conspicuously
to the high death-rate.</p>

<p>The residential suburbs, which are very healthy, stretch east and
west of the town, and are connected with it by rail and electric car.
The former are the more fashionable, and have become familiar
to English readers during the past three years. Rondebosch, in
which is Mr. Rhodes&#8217;s house, Groot Schuur (bequeathed to the
High Commissioner), is five miles out. Claremont, a couple of
miles eastward, has a large and excellent sanatorium which was of
great value to the military. Wynberg, a mile further east, has a
military hospital, and is a particularly healthy and pleasant district.
It has an excellent independent water-supply. The Government
wine-farm, Constantia, which gives the name to the well-known
Cape liqueur, is situated in the neighbourhood. The suburban railway
is continued to the east, passing by Muizenberg and Kalk Bay,
favourite seaside resorts for holiday-makers, and terminating at
Simonstown, the headquarters of the Cape and West Coast Imperial
naval squadrons. To the west of the bay lie the suburbs
of Green and Sea Point, separated from the town by a large
expanse of flat open land adjoining the sea, and called &#8220;the
Common,&#8221; upon which a large military camp was located during
the war. The fresh Atlantic breezes blow directly across the
Point, and this is one of the healthiest spots on the coast-belt. A
magnificent new road, the Victoria Road, has been made along
the sides of the precipitous slope forming the western edge of
the Cape peninsula, as far as Houts Bay. From this there is an
inland carriage-drive to Wynberg. The Victoria road a little
resembles, but is far more magnificent than, the celebrated Corniche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
road in the French Riviera. The late Lord Carnarvon, when he
visited South Africa in 1887, called this &#8220;the finest drive in the
world.&#8221; January, February, and March are the hottest months
of the year in Cape Town. The mean maximum temperature for
these three months is 80°. June, July, and August are the coldest,
with a mean maximum of 62°, and a mean minimum of 49°. Clothing
as for the English summer and winter respectively is recommended,
but it must be remembered that even in summer the nights are cool,
a drop of over 20° between midday and evening temperatures being
common. The mean humidity is 79.</p>

<p>Fruit in the Cape peninsula is plentiful and good&mdash;grapes,
oranges, tangerines, peaches, apricots, nectarines, strawberries,
plums, apples, quinces, melons, pears, pomegranates, grenadillas,
loquats, figs, guavas, tomatoes, are all procurable in season. The
flora of the Cape peninsula is one of the most interesting in the
world. Over 10,000 varieties of heath have been described as
occurring in this small area. Mr. Chamberlain should be interested
in the <i>Disa grandiflora</i>, the celebrated orchid to be found
only on the summit of Table Mountain.</p>

<p>It is well to give a caution as to the prevalence of venomous
snakes which abound in the Cape peninsula and South Africa
generally. The cobra and the puff-adder are the most dangerous
of these fearsome things. A celebrated South African
authoress has confided to me that her habit of looking at her
feet when walking, a habit upon which she received much banter
in Europe, was derived from her early timidity of snakes.
Cautious observation of one&#8217;s tread in tramping across the Cape
plains is very necessary, and many fatal accidents have been due
to carelessness in this respect. The visitor is strongly urged to
carry with him on any such expedition a hypodermic syringe and a
supply of Calmette&#8217;s &#8220;Antivenene,&#8221; which may be obtained from the
British Institute of Preventive Medicine. Calmette&#8217;s experiments
go to show that the venom of all species of snakes and of scorpions is
of a similar nature. His serum is obtained by the inoculation of horses
with the poison of the cobra. The remedial injection should be made
immediately upon the occurrence of the bite. The serum keeps well
for months if retained in a cool dark place. The dose is about five
cubic centimetres of the serum, to be injected hypodermically.</p>

<p>It is curious that this late observation of modern science should
have been in a measure anticipated by the natives, who have been
accustomed for many years to eat snakes and swallow their venom,
with a view to render themselves immune to the bites of these reptiles.</p>

<p>An infective sore, occurring mostly on the hands and feet, is
often contracted in walking on the veldt in South Africa, and it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
been called veldt-sore. Its bacteriology has lately been thoroughly
worked out, and it appears to be due to a specific micro-organism,
though Professor Wright, of Netley, claims it to be the ordinary
microbe of suppuration. I have had personal experience of this
small ailment, and can vouch for the discomfort and intractability of
the sore thus produced. Free drainage of the wound and antiseptic
dressings are recommended.</p>

<p>Another note of warning may be fitly included here. Domestic
service being performed almost entirely by natives, it is often necessary
to entrust young children to their care. Unhappily, venereal
diseases are exceedingly common among the coloured population. I
have seen deplorable instances of the infection of young children with
gonorrh&oelig;a and syphilis derived from their native nurses. These
should, therefore, be selected with the utmost circumspection.</p>

<p>Durban, the second most usual termination of the voyage from
Europe, is the seaport of the Colony of Natal. Cape Town and
Durban have the distinction of being the only ports in South Africa
at which landing can be effected direct from the ocean-steamers.
The hottest months are January, February, and March, with a
mean maximum of 84°, and a mean humidity of 76 per cent. Its
dry season is the winter, and it is at its best then, and is a favourite
winter resort for residents of Johannesburg, from which it is only
twenty-four hours by rail. From April to September, bright, clear,
sunny weather may be expected, and the climate is exceedingly
enjoyable. The town is one of the most English in South Africa,
and its hotels, boarding-houses, &amp;c., are good, but woefully deficient
in number for the present influx of settlers. Houses are extremely
difficult to procure, and building is very expensive. The recent
working of important coalfields near Durban has increased its value
as a port and coaling station. The water-supply is ample and
excellent, being derived from rivers several miles from the town,
and being passed through filter-beds before distribution. A modern
drainage system is approaching completion, and the town is being
supplied with electric lighting. Mangoes, pine-apples, bananas, and
custard apples are plentiful, in addition to many of the fruits previously
enumerated as growing in the Cape Colony. There are
large sugar and tea plantations in the vicinity, and rice, coffee,
pepper, and tobacco are cultivated with success. To sum up, it
may be said that although the summer humidity and heat make it
not well suited for phthisical patients, the town is in the winter
months one of the healthiest in South Africa, and one of the most
progressive and pleasant to live in.</p>

<p>Port Elizabeth, the third most important of the coast-towns, is
not to be recommended as a permanent residence for invalids. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
rainfall is more evenly distributed through the year, and the humidity,
which is remarkably constant, is about 75 per cent. The
variations in summer and winter heat are also within a small range;
the highest mean temperature for summer being 75°; the lowest
mean for winter 48°. But the winds are trying, and render it
unsuitable for invalids. Uitenhage, a small village three-quarters
of an hour&#8217;s run from Port Elizabeth, is far healthier, and is rapidly
becoming a favourite suburb. It has an exceptionally good water-supply.
In the near neighbourhood are the largest vineyards in the
Eastern Province.</p>

<p>These three towns may serve as types of the climatic conditions
to be met with on the south-western, southern, and south-eastern
coast-line respectively. It must be again emphasised that climatically
none of the coast resorts are as beneficial for phthisis and
chest affections generally as the uplands; but that other factors
render them at the present time, and for the immediate future, the
most suitable resorts for the seriously ill. And though climatically
they are not the best that South Africa can afford, they are,
nevertheless, better than most of the European resorts that have
hitherto been frequented. For they all afford more prolonged sunshine,
and purer air, and are more exempt from the infectivity of
overcrowding than is the case with the fashionable recruiting places
of Europe. But it is to the highlands of South Africa that we eventually
look with confidence as promising the maximum of benefit,
which will be available as soon as the difficulties of food and accommodation
and social environment are adjusted. From the coast-line
a series of terraces rise to the northward, with extreme regularity on
the western three-fourths, with less uniformity on the eastern fourth
of the southern continent, as far as the Zambesi. Four terraces may
thus be distinguished, and are divided as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The coast plateau comprising the land within fifty miles of
the coast, and reaching a level below 1000 feet.</p>

<p>2. The Southern Karroo, the plateau between the Outeniqua and
Langenbergen mountains to the south, and the Zwaartebergen
to the north. Level from 1000 to 1500 feet.</p>

<p>3. The Great or Central Karroo, the plateau between the
Zwaartebergen range to the south, and the Nieuwveld and
Roggeveld to the north. Height between 2000 and 3000
feet.</p>

<p>4. The Northern Karroo, stretching north to the Orange River
at a level of 4000 feet and over. The Transvaal and
Rhodesia, though not commonly included as within the
Karroo districts, are high tablelands with similar altitudes,
and may be described under this heading.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>The climate of the coast plateau is similar to that of the seaboard,
and much need not be added to the description given under
that heading. Visitors to the higher plains of South Africa must be
warned to go not unprovided with warm clothing, and to be careful of
evening chills. The fall of temperature as night comes is very great.
It has been observed that chills which in England usually result in
nasal catarrh, in South Africa take the form of intestinal catarrh,
and most visitors experience this discomfort soon after arrival.</p>

<p>In the Southern Karroo is situated the important health-resort of
Ceres, much frequented by the residents of Cape Town, from which
it is distant only 84 miles. It is a pretty little Dutch town, 1700
feet above sea-level, with picturesque surroundings. It has a
small sanatorium under very competent medical supervision. The
water-supply is derived from mountain springs, and is very pure.
The climate is drier than that of the coast plateau, and its ease of
access from Cape Town enables supplies to be readily brought up.
Being within the line of winter rains it is not recommended for
phthisical patients in other than summer months, but during the
latter, which may be taken as extending from October to March,
the phthisical patient could live and sleep in the open air in
properly-constructed sanatoria. It is much to be desired that further
accommodation of this kind should be supplied, as Ceres forms a
comfortable halting-place, where the phthisical patient may with
advantage spend a few weeks on his road to the higher plateaux,
and it would be an invaluable resort for delicate persons whom
physicians are obliged to send out of England during the English
winter, a time at which Ceres would be at its best.</p>

<p>Grahamstown, though not properly in the Southern Karroo, is at
nearly the same level, 1700 feet, as Ceres, and may be considered here.
Its rains occur mostly in the summer, and it is consequently more
to be recommended as a winter resort. It is one of the prettiest
towns in South Africa and one of the most English, and it vies
with the capital in educational facilities. It is best reached from
Port Elizabeth, from which it is 100 miles by rail, but the journey
occupies nine hours. Its climate is remarkably equable but somewhat
damp. It has a public library, second only to that of Cape
Town, and a magnificent museum. Sport is still to be procured in
the neighbourhood, and the society is more cultured and intellectual
than is the case in many colonial towns. It has long enjoyed the
sobriquet of the &#8220;City of the Saints,&#8221; and is a pleasant and healthy
place for family settlement, the schools being numerous and excellent.
It is not, however, so well adapted for the presence of
sanatoria for phthisis as many other districts in South Africa, owing
to its humidity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The Great or Central Karroo and the Northern Karroo may be
considered together, as they have very similar climates, differing
only in the greater height of the northern plateau with the consequent
influences on temperature and dryness. It may be said to
offer a crescendo of advantage as the elevation increases. Here is
probably to be found one of the most perfect climates in the world
for tuberculosis, and one of the most healthy and invigorating. I
would defy the most miserable hypochondriac alive to remain uncheerful
on a bright sunny day on these glorious uplands. His
struggle to remain lugubrious would be as hopeless as Mr. Thompson&#8217;s
after his second glass of port, even when that gentleman&#8217;s deference
for Sir Austin Feverel urgently required the effort. Something of
the same exhilaration may be felt in the higher Swiss altitudes, but
unaccompanied by the vivifying influences of the sun. Sunshine and
pure air, it must be remembered, are the strongest bactericidal agents
known. Mr. Clinton Dent, lecturing at St. George&#8217;s Hospital, gave
expression to his astonishment at the surgical triumphs of healing,
which he attributed to pure air, achieved under his observation during
the war. The dryness, and consequent clearness, of the air are
remarkable, and indeed incredible to the northern European. This
feature explains the inferior shooting of our soldiers on their first
arrival in South Africa; they would invariably sight their rifles too
low, their targets being, in fact, far more distant than seemed possible
by reason of the clearness. And this dryness makes it possible to
tolerate extremes both of heat and cold which without this factor
would mean serious discomfort.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;"><a name="illustration_58" id="illustration_58"></a>

</div>

<p>In fact, the moist warmth of our English summers is infinitely
more oppressive and less easily borne than the far higher temperatures,
but tempered by comparative absence of moisture, which
prevail in the Karroo. The rarity of sunstroke throughout South
Africa is a clinical observation which establishes the truth of the
statements just made. In the records of a military hospital in the
Northern Karroo during the months from August to April, including
therefore the hottest time of the year, out of 3000 medical cases
not a single instance of sunstroke was noted. The experience
gained in this hospital has an additional value from the circumstance
that the gifted physician, the late Dr. Washbourn, was the observer,
and some of the results he records may be more eloquent than
many pages of description. Of the medical cases (nearly 3000),
546 were enteric, 379 dysentery, 296 muscular rheumatism, 258
malaria, 187 &#8220;continued fever,&#8221; 152 diarrh&oelig;a, 93 jaundice, 70
tonsilitis, 71 influenza, and only 43 bronchitis and chest affections.
Dr. Washbourn acutely remarks, &#8220;From this list it may be roughly
concluded that the air in South Africa is good; the food bad.&#8221; It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
will be noticed that intestinal diseases form more than a third of the
total. The dysentery was probably due to faulty ingesta and not
to the specific organism usually associated with dysentery, since
am&oelig;bæ coli could not be found in the stools. Malaria occurs only
in limited areas in the northern Transvaal and parts of Rhodesia; the
Karroo proper and the coast-belt are entirely free. The causation
of malaria is now so well understood that it must yearly become a
more and more preventable disease. But the great outstanding
features of the list, the prevalence of intestinal diseases, the absence
of respiratory troubles, merit closer examination. The intestinal
diseases, under which the muscular rheumatism, (caused by toxines),
the jaundice, and much of the continued fever, must be included, are
due to ingesta, <i>i.e.</i> food and water. The difficulty of obtaining
good food, and the absence of sanitation which is the main cause of
the impurity of the water, are the obstacles which must speedily be
overcome in order to make the second feature assume its proper
value in the treatment of disease. The rainfall is everywhere
adequate for the supply of pure water, but this must be properly
stored and kept from contagia. The interesting experiments
which Dr. Vivian Poore has made on the subject of rural hygiene are
convincing as to the possibility of disposing of excreta with complete
security to health, and material profit to the community, without the
necessity of abundant water. He has found that in the dry-earth
system of closets, followed by the application of the excreta to the soil
and their superficial burial in the humus, with subsequent tillage,
a perfectly successful system of drainage is obtainable. In an acre
and a half of ground he has for many years disposed of the excreta
of a hundred persons, and the crops he has raised upon this land
have yielded a profit of £50 per annum per acre. It appears to me
fortunate therefore that most of the South African towns (except on
the coast) have not yet adopted the costly and wasteful methods of
destruction of sewage which are the fashion of the moment and
which entail an immense loss of water. An intelligent application
of very simple methods, within the reach of the smallest community
or of the largest town, will ensure proper destruction of excreta,
increased fertility of soil, and security against contamination of
water&mdash;the latter being by far the greatest danger in South
Africa. The supplying of food is intimately bound up with the
conservation of water. The soil of the Karroo is astonishingly
fertile when watered, and irrigation should be widely adopted. In
places where this has been done the most satisfactory results have
been obtained. At Matjesfontein, for example, a small oasis in the
midst of the dry Karroo has been created within recent years by
intelligent methods of irrigation. It is to be hoped that more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
energetic and progressive settlers will ultimately, as farms change
hands under the financial stress of the war, tackle these difficulties
with modern methods of agriculture. When it becomes possible to
obtain fresh food-stuffs at moderate cost, the country will be ripe for
the multiplication of sanatoria and places of reception for invalids
and visitors. The type of sanatorium to be recommended for
phthisical patients is still much debated. The essay of Dr. Latham
and Mr. West, of St. George&#8217;s Hospital, who have lately won the
King&#8217;s prize, offered for the best solution of this question, will be
published within a few weeks, and may go some way towards
settling the model to be adopted. At the present time only a few
sanatoria exist in South Africa, and it will be well to devote a few
words to the localities in which they are to be found.</p>

<p>Beaufort West, on the northern main line from Cape Town, and
Cradock, on the northern main line from Port Elizabeth, are old-established
health-resorts which offer fair accommodation for invalids.
They are of nearly equal altitude, some 2800 feet, and are both in
possession of a good water-supply. Their moderate elevation and
ease of access from the coast render them particularly suitable for
advanced cases of phthisis who are too ill to travel farther north,
and for asthma and cardiac affections.</p>

<p>Howick, on the main north line to the Transvaal from Durban,
altitude 3500 feet, was much used as a convalescent military base
during the war, and is a popular health-resort with adequate invalid
accommodation. It has a good all-the-year-round climate, but is
particularly recommended for the winter, which is its rainless season.
Estcourt, a little farther north on the same line, is some 300 feet
higher, with much the same climate. It has a sanatorium.
Standerton, 5000 feet, near the Natal-Transvaal border, and on
the Durban line, has a bracing winter climate, and is then much
frequented by Johannesburg residents, anxious to escape the dust-storms
of the Rand. Wakkerstroom, 6000 feet, a few miles east of
Standerton, is an advancing health-resort, which has a sanatorium.
It is best adapted for cases of early phthisis. Its altitude contra-indicates
it for persons with heart affections.</p>

<p>Middelburg, 4000 feet, in the Great Karroo, on the Port
Elizabeth line, has a sanatorium, and opportunities of accommodation
in farms in the neighbourhood. It has a summer rainfall, and is
therefore more especially to be recommended as a winter resort.</p>

<p>Kimberley, altitude 4000 feet, on the Great Northern Plateau, is
the fourth largest city in South Africa, and is entirely unique in this,
that it may be described as being run by a benevolent despotism,
that of the De Beers Company, who own the diamond mines. This
company has built at its own cost the best sanatorium in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Africa. The fierce heat and the dust-storms render it somewhat
trying as a permanent residence.</p>

<p>Bloemfontein, 4500 feet, in the Northern Karroo, the capital of
the Orange River Colony, has long been a favourite resort for
phthisical patients, and has a well-deserved reputation for the extreme
dryness of its climate. It has summer rains of short duration but
very heavy while they last. Its mean humidity is 58. December,
January, and February are the hottest months, with a mean maximum
of 85.° It has very fair hotel-accommodation at prices
much lower than those ruling in Johannesburg, and has sanatorium
establishments. It is on the main line of railway from Cape
Town, from Port Elizabeth, and from East London. It has a good
water-supply, and should become a most successful centre for the
treatment of many pulmonary affections. The principal drawback to its
healthiness is the prevalence of dust-storms in the late winter months.</p>

<p>Johannesburg, 5700 feet, in the great northern plateau of the
Transvaal, is the largest and busiest town in South Africa, and cannot,
for these reasons, be recommended as a health-resort; moreover,
for some time to come the scramble for accommodation and the general
roughing that results must keep away all but the most active and
robust. But it is in a very healthy position, and enjoys a splendid
climate for ten months of the year. The later winter months (July
and August) are spoilt by the severe dust-storms, and the wealthier
Johannesburg residents usually leave it during these months. It is
the centre towards which all railways converge, and may be reached
from Cape Town (in 45 hours by mail train, once a week; in 60 hours
by the ordinary daily service), from Port Elizabeth in 43 hours;
from Durban in 24 hours. It has summer rains in heavy downpours,
with clear, fine weather between the showers. The healthiest
parts of Johannesburg are the Hill and Parktown, which are fashionable
suburbs. There are numerous hotels, which at the present time
are very expensive; a single room with board cannot be had under
25s. a day; servants&#8217; wages are high, from £6 to £10 per month;
food-stuffs are dear and difficult to procure; fresh meat is unobtainable,
all supplies being imported frozen; eggs are 11s. a dozen;
milk 1s. a pint; house-rent, for a six-roomed house, averages from
£20 to £30 a month. These details are mentioned to give the
intending visitor warning what he may expect at the present
moment; and the great rush which is continuing will doubtless
keep up the prices and lack of accommodation, so that for a considerable
time to come Johannesburg is a place for the delicate and
the ill to avoid.</p>

<p>Pretoria, the official capital of the Transvaal colony, is 30 miles
north of Johannesburg, but it is 1760 feet lower, and is sheltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
and shut in by mountains, which render it a pleasant resort from
Johannesburg in its windy months. The winter climate is delightful.
The sanitation, both of Johannesburg and Pretoria, is very imperfect
and bad, and enteric and dysentery are in consequence very prevalent.
Pneumonia is one of the scourges of Johannesburg, probably
owing to the frequency of chills, the variation in temperature
from the heat of the day to the cool of the evening being very great&mdash;as
much as 70° at times. Water is not too plentiful, and there
are seasons of scarcity which increase epidemic disease.</p>

<p>Basutoland has been called the Switzerland of South Africa from
its beautiful mountain-scenery. It is, however, not open to invalids,
or indeed to travellers, owing to its being still a native reserve.</p>

<p>Harrismith, 5250 feet, in the Orange River Colony, is probably
the nearest available health-resort to Basutoland, and is an excellent
place for consumption in earlier stages. A sanatorium is being provided.
It is easily reached from Durban. I have known a case of
phthisis with repeated hæmoptysis to be arrested by a visit of six
months to Harrismith.</p>

<p>Rhodesia is, as has been said, a continuation of the elevated
tableland of the great northern plateau, and its climate is very
similar to that of the higher Karroo, with the exception that malaria
is found in some parts of the country, and is not present in the
Karroo. The country is on the whole healthy, but is as yet too
undeveloped to receive invalids.</p>

<h3 class="gap2">THE SPAS OF SOUTH AFRICA</h3>

<p>There are numerous mineral-springs in the country, but they
remain for the most part but little used, and there is here an
excellent opportunity for future development. A few words upon
some of the better known of these may be useful.</p>

<p>Caledon, altitude 900 feet, 80 miles from Cape Town, is the best
known and most developed watering-place in South Africa. A line
of railway, connecting it directly with the Cape main-trunk line, has
just been completed. Its reputation dates from the times of the
earliest Dutch occupation. It has ferruginous springs, both hot and
cold, which offer a most successful treatment for gout, rheumatism,
anæmia, and cardiac diseases and renal insufficiency. There is
excellent and increasing accommodation in connection with the
springs. The climate is very pleasant, and especially to be recommended
in summer, as being drier than the coast towns, though
within such a short distance of Cape Town. The rains are in the
winter.</p>

<p>Brandvlei, near Worcester, 100 miles from Cape Town, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
some very hot sulphur-springs which have not yet been much
used.</p>

<p>Montagu, altitude 750 feet, near Robertson (140 miles by rail
from Cape Town), has some hot mineral-springs which have been
used with success in rheumatism and skin diseases, and there is an
&#8220;établissement des bains&#8221; under progressive management.</p>

<p>Aliwal North, 4500 feet, on the Orange River, best reached from
East London, may be compared to the Swiss watering-place, Loêche,
in the combination of hot sulphur-springs with a great altitude. The
baths are excellent for rheumatism and skin diseases, and good
accommodation is procurable. The climate is a delightful one, with
short summer rains and bright dry winter. The altitude is unfavourable
for cardiac affections, but good for phthisis, and this
has long been a much commended resort for the latter disease.</p>

<p>Warmbaths, altitude about 5000 feet, a thermal spring, connected
by rail with Johannesburg and Pretoria (from the latter of which it
is distant 70 miles), is rapidly becoming an important spa. The
water issues at a very high temperature. It is ferruginous, sulphurous,
and alkaline. Increased accommodation here is very
desirable, and will no doubt be rapidly supplied. Rheumatic
affections, anæmia, and skin diseases are benefited by this treatment,
but heart disorders are aggravated by the high elevation.</p>

<p>It is impossible within the limits assigned to me to go into
further details about the magnificent opportunities for the health-seeker
which this great country must offer in the near future. To
those who have been bred under those kindly skies, and who have
left them permanently, an incurable nostalgia often comes, when the
burden of this murk-laden atmosphere of London seems indeed
intolerable. I hope that these few pages may lead many a sufferer
to find new vigour and new courage in that sunnier air. May it
prove to them in very fact a land of Good Hope and pleasant
memories, whether they remain in the country or whether they
make but a fleeting visit.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<h2 class="gap4"><a name="COMMERCIAL_PROSPECTS" id="COMMERCIAL_PROSPECTS"></a>COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By WILLIAM EGLINGTON</span></p>

<p class="center small"><i>Editor and Proprietor of &#8220;The British and South African Export Gazette&#8221;</i></p>

<p>It is somewhat of an anomaly that of the scores of books which
have been published of late years in connection with South
Africa, not one has contained any direct reference to its commerce.
This is the more remarkable when it is remembered
how little is known, outside the circle of those associated with
the trade, of its actual extent and importance. It is true that here
and there in the daily press statements, more or less accurate, from
time to time appear as to its trend, and of late quite a number of
technical journals, somewhat tardily, appear to have only just
awakened to the fact that the huge demands made upon British
industries by South Africa&#8217;s consumptive requirements are worthy of
further investigation. But however admirable their intentions, the
process of enlightening the public to which they set themselves
would seem to have failed of its object, for the reason that, while
each has done its best in its own particular groove, collectively they
reveal nothing but what interests their own immediate circle of
readers.</p>

<p>In view of the wide publicity given to South African affairs in
recent times, the ignorance of the average man as to the remarkable
expansion which has taken place in South African trade since the
Majuba scuttle is not a little astonishing. He doubtless has a hazy
idea that it runs well into millions, but there his knowledge ceases.
He has had it dinned into his ears that British manufacturers have
been asleep and sacrificed the trade to the greater activities of their
rivals, and while he may deplore this fact, and bewail the decadence
of our erstwhile commercial supremacy in oversea markets, there his
interest ceases. It is with the view of enlightening a wider public as
to the extent and scope of our present trade with South Africa, together
with its future prospects, that this article has reference, and it
will also serve to show, despite erroneous assertions to the contrary,
that we have nothing to fear from foreign competition. However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
lax our manufacturers may have been in the past in allowing their
rivals to secure so firm a footing in a market where, until a few
years ago, they were supreme, after a perusal of the facts herein
adduced it will be conceded that their present position is one
from which it will be a matter of extreme difficulty to dislodge
them.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, South African trade first began to
show signs of expansion after the events which followed upon the
retrocession of the Transvaal to the Boers in 1881. Until that year
it was practically insignificant in its proportions and almost stationary
in its volume, being mainly assisted by the activity shown in the
diamond industry, gold not then having become a factor in quickening
the commercial pulse. In the year named, the total imports
into the country from all sources amounted to £11,140,027, of
which the Cape Colony took, in round figures, all but two millions.
After 1881, however, the imports steadily, if slowly, increased in
bulk, which was due less to active developments in South Africa
itself than to the gradual opening up of the country after the first
Boer war. In 1891, in which year it may be said the fabulous
wealth of the Witwatersrand first began to attract the attention of
the civilised world, the value of the imports stood at £12,230,270,
of which the Cape Colony took practically the same amount of
goods as in 1881, while Natal had improved her position by
taking about one-fourth of the total. After 1891 the imports
increased with extraordinary rapidity in proportion as the gold
industry made headway, until in 1901 they touched the high-water
mark with £31,595,332, or practically three times what they stood
at twenty years before.</p>

<p>In 1881, the quantity of goods imported from countries other
than England was so insignificant as not to be worth including in
the official returns, and so far as the United States was concerned
absolutely no trade with South Africa was done at all, and but very
little with the European Continent. In 1892, however, Germany
and America began to pay greater attention to the possibilities of
what then showed signs of becoming an exceedingly promising
market, the share of the former country in that year being only
£231,172, while that of the latter was £418,126. How successful
they were in their efforts is seen by the fact that with each succeeding
year the value of the goods entering South Africa from those
countries grew by leaps and bounds, until in 1901 the German share
had increased to £1,118,010, and that of the United States to
£2,640,193. Neither of these amounts was, however, the highest
point reached by either Germany or America, their record years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
being 1896 and 1898 respectively. It is unquestionable that had
British manufacturers paid sufficient attention to the possibilities
of the South African trade in the period from 1881-91, and had
realised how rapidly the country was developing, thereby quickening
them to action, the foreigner would not have got the hold upon its
commerce which he now has, the combined share of all the countries
competing with Great Britain amounting in 1901 to £4,590,681, or
14.9 per cent. of the total imports. Although the purely British
share was as much as 65.6 per cent., the balance being made up by
the shares of our Colonies and non-competing countries (i.e. goods
imported from countries that Great Britain cannot supply), much
remains to be done to retain even that percental share; but it
is satisfactory to note that the lessons of the past have not been
lost upon us, and that with the general awakening to the foreign
menace there is every likelihood that we shall more than hold
our own in the future, provided our manufacturers are not handicapped
by the exactions of labour, the excessive cost of which,
and the general disinclination of the Trades Unions to adopt
modern labour-saving machinery, being the two principal factors
in determining whether competition with other countries shall be
effective or not.</p>

<p>In other words, with the exception of India, where the European
population is not numerous, each white inhabitant in South Africa
spends vastly more in proportion to its population than any of our
other Colonies, or exactly £20, 3s. 7d. per head as against £7, 6s.
for Australia, the next highest, and £1, 11s. 6d. for Canada, the
lowest, or, with black and white combined, £5, 1s. 6d. per head of
the total population, as against 2s. 8d. for India, £1, 10s. 4d. for
Canada, £5, 13s. for Australia, and £6, 16s. for New Zealand. A
reference to the above table clearly shows what an important customer
the South African native is for oversea goods, his annual
purchases amounting to £6, 15s. 6d., which it will be seen is even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
more per head than that of the Australian white population. This
latter assumption is, of course, purely deductive, but it is in the main
fairly accurate.</p>

<p>Not only this, but it will surprise many to learn that of the total
British exports to our Colonies and India, South Africa is our

<p>This brief digest will doubtless be sufficient to prove that South
Africa, as a market, is to-day one of the best customers of the
Motherland, and, as will be shown later, when dealing with the
future outlook for Imperial trade with that country, bids fair to speedily
overtop in her demands upon the United Kingdom and her Colonies
and dependencies that of any single member of the Imperial family,
India&mdash;of all our possessions at present our best customer&mdash;not
even excepted. And what will readily be conceded is a satisfactory
feature in our commercial relations with South Africa is the remarkable
growth which has characterised the exports thither from British
possessions and Protectorates other than the Mother Country itself,
the total proportion in 1901 being £4,733,800, as against £4,590,681,
the value of the combined trade with South Africa in that year of
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Switzerland,
and the United States.</p>

<p>Why South Africa must, for many years to come, remain our
best customer, ever increasing its demands upon our industries, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
not difficult of comprehension to those who are acquainted with its
circumstances. Although it is more than capable in proper hands
and with the assistance of capital of being self-supporting, beyond
its gold, diamonds, and coal, it produces little or nothing to speak
of. It has one of the finest climates in the world; its soil is more
than ordinarily fertile, and only requires water to yield a harvest
more than sufficient for its consumptive needs, which could easily be
obtained if the ample rainfall were properly conserved and irrigation
resorted to on an intelligent principle. Incredible as it may seem,
even the mealies or maize, which it could grow in sufficient quantity,
without recourse to irrigation, to supply its own wants and leave a
margin for export, are imported to the amount of something like
£350,000 annually. Its iron deposits are probably unequalled elsewhere;
its seas teem with fish, and its orchards and vineyards groan
with the yield which nature lavishes with but little assistance from
man. Yet on the shelves of every store throughout the country will
be found imported canned fish and fruit, mainly from America; and
while it is true that here and there jam factories are to be found,
and the sugar cane grows almost wild in Natal, probably more than
half a million yearly is disbursed on imported jams, confectionery,
syrups, and the like. Tea likewise flourishes in Natal, but South
Africa imports nearly £200,000 worth yearly; fresh and preserved
vegetables, to its shame, are actually landed to the value of £80,000
annually, although, like most other foodstuffs, the soil grows them
in luxuriant profusion; and of wine, despite the fact that the huge
quantities made at the Cape, if properly treated according to
European methods, would be unsurpassed in the world, the oversea
product stands for nearly £300,000.</p>

<p>Moreover, as a cattle country many parts of South Africa are
probably unrivalled, notwithstanding which both live and dead stock
are freely imported, and while it could support millions of sheep it
prefers the frozen mutton of New Zealand and the Argentine.
Whoever is to blame for this state of things, which, happily, under
the new <i>regime</i> and with the influx of population from European
countries will gradually be altered, it is certain that, until the old
order changes (and this will probably be a work of decades), South
Africa must rely upon oversea goods for the maintenance of its
growing population, as also for the means wherewith to extract its
marvellous mineral wealth. According to Mr. W. Willcocks,
C.M.G., if the irrigation schemes which are projected in the
Transvaal and Orange River Colonies are ever carried into effect,
they will add something like £200,000,000 to the value of the
agricultural land, a consummation which, in its own interests as well
as for our own industries, is devoutly to be wished. If it be true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
as is repeatedly asserted by those most competent to judge, that
South Africa&#8217;s vast mineral deposits have only been &#8220;scratched,&#8221;
how much more does this remark apply to its agriculture, which,
after all, is the staple wealth of all countries, and which has made
the United States and Canada what they are to-day?</p>

<p>Enough has probably been said of the South African trade of
the past and present, although the subject is of such profound
interest to the student that it deserves greater space than is possible
within the scope of a single article. It is to the future that we have
now to direct our attention, and it is in attempting to forecast the
probable trend of the trade in the years to come that speculation
becomes positively fascinating. In making this endeavour, it is
well to bear in mind that assumption will be based upon such facts
as are within our common knowledge, and therefore may be accepted
as a reliable, although not infallible, guide as to what may safely be
expected of South African commerce in the future. Setting aside
for the moment the possibility of the soil being made to yield any
greater abundance than is now the case, or that other than its existing
insignificant industries will be promoted or developed, we will
first of all confine our investigations to how far South Africa&#8217;s
mineral wealth will beneficially affect trade pure and simple. Altogether,
irrespective of the Cape, Natal, Rhodesia, and the Orange
River Colony, the mining, exploration, and investment companies at
present in existence in the Transvaal alone, or connected therewith,
number something like 350, representing a capital of £250,000,000,
or about what the war has cost us. Many attempts have been made
by competent experts in the past to forecast what the several sections
of the Witwatersrand only will yield in gold as interest on this huge
sum before the mines at present in working or in process of being
worked are exhausted, but few approximate with such exactitude
the recent estimates of Messrs. Frederick H. Hatch and T. H.
Leggett, both of whom are authorities whose views are entitled to
the greatest respect. They have had many years&#8217; practical experience
of the Transvaal mines, and owing to the uniformity of the
yield, tested at a depth of nearly 5000 feet, to which they limit
themselves in their calculations, they are of opinion that the gold
yet to be extracted from Randfontein on the west to Modderfontein
on the east amounts to the almost incalculable total of
£1,310,323,000, and that the life of this section is forty-two and
a half years.</p>

<p>Now, as it is indisputable that South African trade is in the
main practically dependent upon the country&#8217;s mineral wealth, it is
not a matter of supreme difficulty to arrive at some definite conclusion
as to what effect the extraction of this stupendous amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
will have upon its consumptive requirements. Herein lies its
supreme significance to manufacturers, and particularly to those who
are our countrymen. The experts cited are of opinion that by June
1906 the annual output of gold from this section alone will amount to
£30,000,000, which compares with £20,000,000, the estimated yield
for 1899, had not the war intervened. According to figures taken
from the reports issued by the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines,
something like 75 per cent. of the yearly output of but seventy-four
of the mining companies producing the £20,000,000 referred to has
been spent in the past on machinery, stores, development, labour, &amp;c.,
which would mean a local disbursement alone of £22,500,000 in
1906 to win the £30,000,000 estimated as the yield in that year by
Messrs. Hatch and Leggett. But, according to Mr. A. R. Goldring,
secretary to the Johannesburg Chamber of Mines, who bases his
data upon information supplied by the leading Rand engineering
experts, in 1907 no fewer than 17,000 head of stamps will be at
work, being an increase of 11,000 on the number in operation just
previous to the outbreak of the war. If the annual output of
£20,000,000 involved the expenditure of £15,000,000 on stores,
machinery, wages, &amp;c., Mr. Goldring&#8217;s estimate of the number of
stamps that will be at work in 1907 means the disbursement of the
gigantic sum of £42,500,000 as the total contribution which the
Rand gold industry alone will expend for the benefit of the
merchants and manufacturers of the Mother Country and the world
at large. If to this estimate be added the expenditure necessitated
by the numerous diamond and copper mines and collieries in the
Cape Colony, Orange River Colony, Natal, and the Transvaal,
coupled with that of the Rhodesian gold mines and collieries, as
well as the gold mines in districts other than the Witwatersrand,
such as Barberton and Zoutpansberg, &amp;c., a reasonable estimate
should place the total disbursements of the entire mining industry
in South Africa in, say, five years at £50,000,000 sterling, which,
added to the normal requirements of the country apart from those
of mining, would mean an annual outlay of at least £60,000,000
for the benefit of commerce.</p>

<p>It will be seen that no allowance is here made for possible
developments in agriculture and kindred pursuits, which may not
unreasonably be expected to ensue as the result of the fostering
care of the administrations, under the Imperial Government, of the
Transvaal and Orange River Colonies, although large disbursements
might with perfect safety be placed to the credit of these and other
industries which may safely be assumed to be promoted during the
interval between the present and the year to which these estimates
relate. That the Rand gold industry can never be checked again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
short of another war, which is extremely improbable, is as certain
as that the sun shines, and the same remark applies to the other
mineral propositions. It is therefore well within the bounds of probability
to predict that the total purchasing capacity of South Africa
five years hence will be at least £60,000,000 sterling per annum
(which is an exceedingly moderate computation in view of the fact
that the estimated total in 1902 is £42,000,000), a sum which,
assuming our other colonies and possessions do not advance in the
same ratio, will make that country an easy first as Great Britain&#8217;s
best market. If Messrs. Hatch and Leggett be correct in their
surmise that the life of the Rand is forty-two and a half years&mdash;and
in the main they are supported by other competent authorities&mdash;excluding
altogether the possibility of other discoveries of precious
metals and minerals in that long interval, and eliminating for the
moment, what is improbable, that the remainder of the three
hundred and fifty mining and exploration companies above referred
to remain idle meantime, or that their number is not hugely increased,
we arrive at a total expenditure of <i>two thousand five hundred
and fifty millions sterling</i> as South Africa&#8217;s contribution to trade
in the period in question. As it would be futile to dilate upon
what this overwhelming sum means to British industries, it must
be left to the imagination. It is worth thinking about nevertheless.</p>

<p>There is, however, always the pessimist to be considered in
these matters. While no doubt he will content himself with the
satisfactory outlook for British trade which is here unfolded, he
may, in anticipation of time, begin to worry himself as to what will
happen when the Rand is no more, and when its thousands of
stamps are lying idle for the want of further quartz to crush. If
one cared or dared to venture upon the hazardous ground of
prophecy, one might easily foretell the possibility of other Rands
being discovered meanwhile, with the practical certainty that a
hundred years hence South Africa&#8217;s gold yield, instead of showing
diminution, will largely exceed even present anticipations; and here
it is justifiable to intrude the remark that every expert, without
exception, who is connected with its gold industry, is unanimous
in asserting that mining has hardly been begun, and that the future
will exceed the expectations of even the most optimistically inclined.
But, granted that the pessimist be correct that in fifty years the gold
will cease to yield and the Rand be a barren, silent waste, is it quite
safe to conclude that meanwhile the country has remained at a
standstill except for its mining activities? Are the £200,000,000
sterling which Mr. W. Willcocks, C.M.G., the distinguished irrigation
expert, asserts will add to the value of the country as agricultural
land if irrigation be resorted to, to be counted as nothing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and is there not the remote possibility of South Africa taking its
natural place among the world&#8217;s producers of other staples than gold?
What of its vast coal and iron deposits, its saltpetre, its petroleum,
and its countless other products which to-day are but waiting the
advent of capital to bring into being, all of which, like its gold, have
yet to astonish the world? Gold or no gold, the country must, as
the years unfold, become a teeming hive of industry, the only
approximation to which is that of the United States of America.
South Africa, then, is no place for the pessimist, and the sooner
that is understood, the greater the peace of mind of that misguided
individual.</p>

<p>As to the trend of the gigantic trade that is before South Africa,
it has been incontestably shown that the proportion enjoyed by the
Mother Country, and that of its colonies and possessions, is immeasurably
in advance of that of all other nations combined, despite the
ravings of the alarmists as to the alleged incursions of our rivals on
what are pre-eminently our own domains. This fact must not,
however, lull us into the false security of our peaceful slumbers of
twenty, or even ten, years ago, when we had the field to ourselves,
and which we might have retained even now but for our ignorance
of its potentialities. The competition to be faced is a keen one;
the trade is there and must remain there, in all human probability,
for all time, in increasing quantity&mdash;for it can never retrograde;
and only the alertness, the unceasing activity of those who are
interested in retaining it, will preserve the major portion to our own
industries. In endeavouring to show that the future outlook for
South African trade is one which our manufacturers cannot possibly
ignore, by reason of its incalculable vastness, it is reasonable to
suppose that each member of the Imperial family, whether it be the
Mother Country, its offsprings, or the humblest citizen of either, will
strain every nerve to conserve to it the spoils for which such
sacrifices in blood and treasure have been made, thus handing down
to our children a heritage of wealth which is their right equally as it
is our duty.</p>

<p>Much might be written in confutation of the many alarmist
reports as to the decadent condition into which British trade has
fallen of late years, but, after all, is this worth while? Admitted
that, inflated with our past prosperity, we have slumbered on
undisturbed by the thought of what the to-morrow will bring, it
would need greater imagination than the prospective garnering
of the two thousand five hundred millions sterling which it has
been shown is likely to fall into the lap of the world&#8217;s traders
as the result of the future expansion of South Africa in less
than fifty years, to suppose that our manufacturers have sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>denly
become bereft of their senses not to seize the most of
their opportunities. It is easy to decry their enterprise, to compare
their alleged shortcomings with the activities and the asserted
&#8220;pushful&#8221; tendencies of their competitors&mdash;thus advertising the
latter at their expense&mdash;but how much of foundation is there
in such reports? The brief statistics with which this article is
accompanied&mdash;and they have been confined to the narrowest possible
limits&mdash;conclusively show that, so far as South African trade is concerned,
British manufacturers are more than holding their own; and
there cannot be the least doubt that they will continue to do so in
the years of prosperity and expansion that are before the sub-continent,
provided they are assisted by the ungrudging efforts
of labour. This is a matter which need not be intruded here, but it
is one upon which the maintenance of our supremacy in the world&#8217;s
markets will depend, and it is one, too, which could be more profitably
discussed by those whose apparent mission is to belittle everything
that is British in favour of those who, in South Africa as
elsewhere, are striving to wrest our commerce from us. As has
been shown, the future outlook for trade in that country is of the
brightest, and that we shall not prove equal to the task of maintaining
our position there is a contemplation that does not come within
the scope of probability.</p>

CONSTABULARY</h2>

<p class="center">VIEWS OF MAJOR-GENERAL BADEN-POWELL</p>

<p>Believing that a short account of the origin and object
of the force known as the South African Constabulary
for the Orange River and Transvaal would be interesting
to those anxious for the prosperity of the new Colonies,
General Baden-Powell, the originator of the highly-practical
scheme, was invited to contribute to this volume a brief <i>resumé</i>
of his important work. The General in his reply said, &#8220;I am very
sorry that it is quite impossible for me, under present pressure of
work, to contribute an article;&#8221; but he kindly furnished an outline of
his scheme, which serves to enlighten home-staying people regarding
the importance of this irregular arm of the British service.</p>

<p>In brief the General writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can only say of the South African Constabulary that it is not formed
on lines exactly identical with any other Police Force, although in many
respects similar to some.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Military Mounted Police is a bugbear to most administrators, as being
an expensive luxury; but I think that it is rather like what a steam-engine is to a
Boer farmer&mdash;once he knows how to apply it to the many uses of which it is
capable, independent of what has been the practice of his predecessors&mdash;it
will be found to be an economy in place of a luxury.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have schemed the South African Constabulary to that end, viz., as the
machinery for performing many duties not hitherto included in the province of
Police; and my one hope is that it may be found effective for the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the best paid force of its kind, and by careful selection and elimination
I expect it to be the best in quality.</p>

<p>&#8220;It numbers at present 10,000 whites and 1000 natives, but these numbers
will be liable to alterations as the country progresses.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is divided into four separate self-contained Divisions carrying out the
duties of District and Town Police in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony,
together with their subordinate departments of Criminal Investigation and
Intelligence, and many minor and temporary duties, such as medical, agricultural,
and veterinary, postal and customs, sanitary, public works, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>&#8220;With a good Reserve, as the Force will shortly have, of men settled in
the country in civil situations, and with its married establishment of 600
families, the South African Constabulary will also take an important share in
the development of the Colony, and will at the same time be in a position to
supply a well-trained mounted force for military work should emergency arise.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This force has been formed for the maintenance of order and
public security in the Orange River Colony and the Transvaal, but
is available for service in any part of British South Africa. It acts
as a District Mounted Police in time of peace, and as a military
force in time of war. At one period drafts of about 80 men per
month were despatched from Great Britain and Ireland, but now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
owing to the cessation of the war, recruiting is closed. From time
to time new blood may yet be in demand. Candidates had to be
good readers, writers, spellers, riders, and shots. Single men were
preferred, and recommendations, particularly as to sobriety, had to
be forthcoming. The term of engagement was for three years for
those recruited in the British Isles, with the possibility, for non-commissioned
officers and men, of re-engaging on increased pay.
The term of service for men enlisted in South Africa (who had not
been given a passage) was two years. Promotion by merit and
commissions are obtainable from the ranks. The age of candidates
is not under 20 nor over 35. The standard of height, without
boots, is not over 6 ft. 2 ins. nor under 5 ft. 4 ins. The chest
measurement, deflated, is not under 34 inches, and the weight, without
clothes, is not over 13 stone 7 lbs. nor under 9 stone.</p>

<blockquote><p>Pay, as well as promotion, is largely in accordance with a man&#8217;s efficiency
and behaviour, troopers being divided into three classes, and non-commissioned
officers into four, for this purpose. Promotion from one class to another among
troopers depends on their qualifying in Constabulary duties, musketry, signalling,
language, and other tests, and on their continuing efficient in these
subjects. Men of all grades entered at the lowest pay of their grade. Men
selected in Great Britain and Ireland joined as third-class troopers. Promotion
in the non-commissioned officers&#8217; ranks will generally only be granted
to those who qualify in colloquial Dutch. Men desirous of marrying while in
the South African Constabulary need to obtain the sanction of the Officer Commanding
Division to their doing so, they are then entitled to an allowance to
cover lodging and other expenses, such as rations, fuel, light, &amp;c., at the consolidated
rate of 3s. a day. On completion of the first three years&#8217; service a
man may, if approved by the Officer Commanding Division, re-engage for a
further term of two years, at 3d. a day extra. On completion of his five years
he may re-engage for further service by the year, if the Officer Commanding
Division approves, at 6d. a day for every additional year, until the total increase
of pay for re-engagement shall have reached 2s. per diem. Rations, horse,
forage, clothing, equipment, arms, quarters, and medical attendance are supplied
free. In exceptional circumstances, where rations cannot be supplied, a ration
allowance will be made of 2s. per diem.</p>

<p>A non-commissioned officer or man may be discharged at any time by order
of the Officer Commanding Division with or without gratuity. Discharge may
be purchased, with consent of Officer Commanding Division, for £20 during
first year, £15 during second year, and £10 during third year.</p>

<p>Any Non-commissioned Officer or Trooper may, with the approval of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Commanding Officer, be transferred to the Reserve, provided that there is a
vacancy for him, at the end of his first engagement (three years), or if he
re-engages, at the end of any period of re-engagement, up to the completion of
five years from his first entry into the service. Every man transferred to the
Reserve is required to remain in it and have his permanent residence in the
Orange River Colony or the Transvaal, unless discharged, up to the end of
seven years from the date of his first entry into the service. A man wishing
to purchase his discharge from the Reserve may do so on payment of £12 at
any period of his service in the Reserve. He will receive while in the Reserve
pay at the rate of £1 per month. He will be liable to be called out annually
for not more than ten consecutive days for training, and shall also be liable to
be called out for active service at any time by the proclamation of the administrator,
governor, or other person exercising for the time being supreme
authority in the Transvaal or Orange River Colony, declaring the existence
of a state of war, or of such serious menace to the peace as to render mobilisation
necessary. While on training or on active service he will receive full pay
at the same rate which he was enjoying when transferred to the Reserve.
In addition to their pay, Reservists, if they desire to settle on the land, will
receive special consideration in any Government-aided scheme of settlement.</p>

<p>Proposals are at present under consideration, whereby suitable settlers may
be assisted to acquire land, and be aided at starting by Government advances,
the purchase price and capital advanced being repayable on easy terms. If
any plan of this kind is found to be practicable, a certain number of farms
annually will be offered in the first instance to members of the South African
Constabulary, who, having borne a good character, may be desirous of being
transferred to the Reserve with a view to actually settling on the land as
farmers. Similar privileges will, if the opportunity offers, be extended to Non-commissioned
Officers and men who may quit the South African Constabulary
after five or more years&#8217; continuous service, bearing a good character.</p>

<p>Any man having served at least five years continuously in the South
African Constabulary (not including Reserve service) with a good character
will be entitled, on retiring, to a gratuity of one month&#8217;s pay for every year of
service. Men on the Reserve may, with approval of Officer Commanding
Division, be taken on to full pay again at any time for a term of two years at
3d. a day extra pay.</p>

<p>Where a number of men joined from one place they were squadded
together as far as possible in the South African Constabulary. Leave of
absence will where possible be granted to all ranks for one month in each year,
cumulative, on full pay, special conditions ruling shooting leave, and leave to
England or out of South Africa. After four years without leave six months on
full pay will be granted.</p>

<p>Candidates were given a free passage in a transport to South Africa, and a
free railway voucher from their place of residence to the port of embarkation.
They were liable to further medical examination on arrival at the place of
attestation. Any candidate found unsuitable was given a free passage back to
England, provided that he was not rejected for any misrepresentation, misconduct,
or serious fault of his own. After five years&#8217; total service a free third-class
passage home will be granted to men recruited in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The full strength of the Constabulary will in future be six thousand men:
the four thousand enrolled for the war contingency will shortly be disbanded.</p>

<p>These particulars serve to show the nature of the new Force, and give some
idea of its value in preserving the future peace of the King&#8217;s new dominions.</p></blockquote>

<br />
<span class="smaller">MR. CHAMBERLAIN AND THE BOER GENERALS</span></h2>

<p>Soon after the conclusion of the war Generals Botha, De
Wet, and Delarey, in the hope of making favourable arrangements
with the Government on behalf of their fellow-countrymen,
sailed for England. They were greeted by
the British people with unusual cordiality, not because of any
sympathy with the Republics they came to represent, but because it is
a characteristic of the British people to honour brave men, even when
they are defeated foes. General Botha was received by Mr. Chamberlain,
and the Boer future was discussed. A few days later the public
was startled to read in the daily journals the following manifesto entitled,
&#8220;Appeal of the Boer Generals to the Civilised World.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is still fresh in the memory of the world how the Boers, after a terrible
struggle lasting more than two and a half years, were at last obliged to accept
through their representatives at Vereeniging the terms of peace submitted to
them by the Government of King Edward VII. At the same time the representatives
commissioned us to proceed to England in order, in the first place,
to appeal to the new Government to allay the immense distress everywhere
devastating the new colonies. If we did not succeed we were to appeal to the
humanity of the civilised world for charitable contributions. As we have not
succeeded up to the present in inducing the British Government to grant further
assistance to our people in their indescribable distress, it only remains for us to
address ourselves to the peoples of Europe and America.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the critical days through which we have passed it was sweet for
us and ours to receive constant marks of sympathy from all countries. The
financial and other assistance given to our women and children in the concentration
camps, and to the prisoners of war in all parts of the earth contributed
infinitely to mitigate the lot of those poor sufferers, and we take advantage of
this opportunity to express in the name of the people of the late Republics our
fervent thanks to all those who have charitably assisted us in the past. The
small Boer nation can never forget the help it received in its dark hours of
suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people of the Republics were ready to sacrifice everything for their
independence, and now the struggle is over and our people are completely
ruined. Though we have not had the opportunity of drawing up an exact
inventory of the destruction done, we have the conviction, based on personal
experience, that at least thirty thousand houses on Boer farms and a number of
villages were burnt or destroyed by the British during the war. Our homes
with their furniture were burned or destroyed, our orchards were ruined, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
our agricultural implements broken, our mills were destroyed, every living
animal was carried off or killed. Nothing, alas, remained to us. The country
is laid waste. The war demanded many victims, and the land was bathed in
tears. Our orphans and widows have been abandoned. Besides, it is needless
to recall the fact how much will be needed in the future for the education of
the children of the Burghers, who are in great distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;We address ourselves to the world, with the prayer to help us by charitable
contributions for our widows and orphans, for the maimed and other needy
ones, and for the satisfactory education of our children. We allude to the
terrible results of the war in order to bring to the knowledge of the world our
urgent needs, by no means to inflame people&#8217;s minds. The sword is now
sheathed, and all differences are silent in presence of such great misery. The
ruin caused by the war is indescribable, so that the small amount which Great
Britain is to give us, in accordance with the terms of surrender, even were it
multiplied tenfold, would be wholly insufficient even to cover the war losses
alone. The widows, orphans, maimed, needy, and children, on whose behalf
alone we appeal, will receive little of this sum, and in most cases nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;All contributions will be assigned to a fund to be called &#8216;General Fund of
Help for the Boers,&#8217; which will be devoted solely to supplying the wants of
those for whom we are collecting, and to provide for their future. We solicit
the hearty co-operation of the committees existing in the various countries of
Europe and in America. We are now on the point of visiting these countries
in succession with the object of establishing a satisfactory organisation.</p>

<p class="ralign pad1r">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Botha.</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">De Wet.</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Delarey.</span>&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The lamentable representations of this manifesto naturally caused
a profound impression&mdash;and the effect of them was not removed till
late in the year when Mr. Chamberlain&#8217;s correspondence in relation
to the matter was published. This correspondence merits more than
superficial study by those truly interested in the pacification of the
new Colonies, for the evil done by the pronouncements of the Boer
&#8220;appeal&#8221; will live after them, while the good effected by the tardy
publication of the Colonial Secretary&#8217;s refutation will probably be
interred in the official mausoleum. To this end the opening despatch
from Mr. Chamberlain to General Louis Botha, dated Downing
Street, the 6th of November, is here appended:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Since the interview which you had with me at this office on the 5th of
September an &#8216;Appeal of the Boer Generals to the Civilised World&#8217; has been
issued, many of the statements in which have, according to Press reports, been
repeated and enlarged on in the speeches delivered by yourself and General
Delarey and General De Wet during your tour on the Continent.</p>

<p>&#8220;The appeal, I regret to say, appears to me to convey an incorrect and
exaggerated impression of the circumstances to which it refers, and though I
have no desire at this time to enter into controversy, I cannot allow it to pass
altogether in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place I am at a loss to understand why the appeal should open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with a statement that you have not up to the present succeeded in inducing the
British Government to grant further assistance to your people. It is not, indeed,
the intention of his Majesty&#8217;s Government to ask Parliament to authorise any
addition to the free grant of £3,000,000&mdash;a grant which is itself without any
precedent in the history of the world&mdash;but the promise of further assistance by
way of loan on very easy terms, as provided by Article 10 of the Terms of
Surrender, has never been withdrawn; and I think you will agree, on again
consulting the record of our conversation, that there is nothing in the language
which I then used which indicates any intention on the part of his Majesty&#8217;s
Government to withdraw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Further, the expenditure on the Burgher camps which, since the conclusion
of peace, have to a great extent been transformed into organisations for enabling
the people to return to their homes, and the cost of which has been about
£200,000 a month, is being borne by his Majesty&#8217;s Government, and constitutes
in effect a very considerable addition to the free grant.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cost of the camps since their establishment has exceeded £3,000,000,
and there is no room for reasonable doubt that they have been the means of
preserving the lives of thousands of women and children, and of providing the
latter with a better education than they ever had the opportunity of enjoying
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I observe that in an article signed by you in this month&#8217;s <i>Contemporary
Review</i> you make it a complaint that the concentration camps are still being
maintained.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be self-evident that, on the score of expense alone, it is the interest
of his Majesty&#8217;s Government to abolish these camps at the earliest possible
moment, and it is only in the cause of humanity that they continue to maintain
this costly organisation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they were to accept the inferences to be drawn from your statement
they would turn out into the veldt thousands of men, women, and children
whom it has been impossible to return to their farms immediately on the
termination of the war, owing to the absence of sufficient transport and the
scarcity of stock.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have, however, already provided for the return of large numbers of
the population of the camps which had been reduced from 116,000 at end of
May to about 34,000 in the last week of October.</p>

<p>&#8220;I observe that you are reported in the Press to have suggested in a speech
at Paris that the British military authorities deliberately used the sufferings of
women and children to induce their relatives in the field to lay down their
arms, and in the resolution passed at Vereeniging on the 31st of May the
sufferings of the women and children were given as a reason for surrender.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one deplores more than the British Government the high mortality in
the camps during the epidemic of measles and pneumonia, but nothing was
spared that money or science could afford to reduce it, and for the last six
months the average total death-rate in the camps has been about 21 per 1000
per annum, a rate which must be much lower than any which obtained before
the war in normal conditions.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, therefore, clear from the statistics that at the actual time of the
surrender there could have been no cause for anxiety as to the condition of
the women and children then in the British camps; and in confirmation of
this view I may remind you that neither at the time of your conferences with
Lord Kitchener in February 1901 nor in the discussions which preceded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
acceptance of the Terms of Surrender was any request made for special provision
for widows and orphans.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, the request made on both these occasions was that the
sums offered as a free grant by the British Government should be applied to
the payment of notes and receipts for goods requisitioned by the Boer commandoes,
in many cases from persons of considerable means. To this proposal
his Majesty&#8217;s Government objected, and while willing that these notes and
receipts should be accepted as evidence of war losses, they stipulated that the
grant should be applied for the benefit of the destitute, or, in the words of the
Terms of Surrender, &#8216;for the purpose of assisting the restoration of the people
to their homes and supplying those who, owing to war losses, are unable to
provide themselves with food, shelter, and the necessary amount of seed, stock,
implements, &amp;c., indispensable to the resumption of their normal occupation.&#8217;
As at present advised, I believe that the sum allotted will be amply sufficient
for the purpose; but, should more be required, there is one source from which
a substantial addition may be fairly expected.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty&#8217;s Government are aware that large sums were remitted from
the Transvaal to Europe during the war to be expended in the interests of the
South African Republic.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have no desire to question the expenditure of this money so far as
it was legitimately devoted to the purposes for which it was intended, but
they cannot doubt that a large balance still remains which would properly
come to them as the successors of the late South African Republic, and which
they would be prepared to add to the fund provided for the relief of the distressed
burghers and their families. I venture to think that in this matter your wishes
will coincide with mine, and that you will give me any assistance in your
power to discover the persons to whom the money was entrusted, and to obtain
from them a statement of account showing the expenditure and the amount of
the balance which remains over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may add, with regard to the camps, that the reference in the manifesto
to the pecuniary assistance furnished by foreign sympathisers appears to rest
on a misconception. It consisted in the Transvaal of 2646 bales and packages,
chiefly containing clothing and miscellaneous stores, which were brought up
from the coast at military expense, and in the sum of £562, 2s. 2d. received
and distributed through the Burgher Relief Fund. I have not yet received
exact information as to the money contributions to the camps in Orange River
Colony, but it was on a similar scale, and provides no ground whatever for an
unfavourable contrast with British liberality.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the general question of your appeal for help for the widows and
orphans, the maimed and the needy, and for assistance in the education of
the children, I desire to say that the Colonial Government is making itself
entirely responsible for the maintenance of all destitute orphans, including
their food, clothing, supervision, and education. Large orphanages are already
in existence at Irene in the Transvaal, and Brandfort and Springfontein in
the Orange River Colony; and suitable provision is also being made for
widows.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Government have been, and are, making themselves responsible for
the education of the children. In the last year of the war £100,000 was spent
on education in the Transvaal, and £32,500 in the Orange River Colony. At
the date of the signing of peace the number of children in Government schools
in the Transvaal was 28,000, and in the Orange River Colony 14,500. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
contrast to these figures it may be mentioned that under the late Governments
the total number of children being educated never exceeded 15,000 and 9000,
in the South African Republic and Orange Free State respectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;With regard to your statements as to the desolation caused by the war,
I would point out that it was inevitable that much damage should be caused
in consequence of the prolongation of hostilities long after there had ceased
to be any reasonable doubt as to the issue of the war. Though the principal
centres, such as Bloemfontein, Kroonstad, Winburg, Heilbron, Harrismith,
Bethlehem, Ficksburg, Ladybrand, Thaba N&#8217;chu, Bethulie, Fauresmith, Jagersfontein,
Koffyfontein, Boshof, in the Orange River Colony, and Johannesburg,
Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp, Heidelberg, Standerton, Middelburg,
Lydenburg, Pietersburg, Nylstroom, Lichtenburg, Zeerust, Rustenburg, in
the Transvaal, are practically untouched, it is no doubt the case that a large
number of farmhouses and buildings have been damaged or destroyed by one
or other of the belligerents or by natives. The value of such buildings in
South Africa is, however, in most instances not very great, and the pecuniary
loss is probably more than compensated by the increased value of the land.
The heaviest loss, and that temporarily pressing most hardly on the people is,
no doubt, the loss of their stock; but the statement that every living animal
was taken away or killed is a great exaggeration. A recent census taken in
the Orange River Colony shows that, excluding animals belonging to the
military and Repatriation Department, there are now in the colony over
120,000 head of cattle, 700,000 sheep and goats, and 27,000 horses. Similar
figures for the Transvaal are not yet available, but the local government is
spending very large sums to supply stock in both colonies. The Repatriation
Department in the Transvaal is using 36,000 animals for transport alone. It
has already issued some 20,000 head of stock to the farmers, and is in a
position to issue another 35,000 by December 1. Assistance is being given
in the Orange River Colony on a like scale, and ploughs and implements are
being supplied as far as it is possible. So far, indeed, from being a desert
the country will, if rain is abundant, be extensively cultivated at the end of
the year; and it is the earnest hope of his Majesty&#8217;s Government that the
strenuous efforts now being made by the local governments, seconded by the
co-operation of the people themselves, will result in bringing back a degree of
prosperity in no way inferior to that existing before the war.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This despatch satisfactorily disposed of many vexed questions,
and comfortable corroboration of the statements made therein is to
be found within the pages of General De Wet&#8217;s account of the
&#8220;Three Years&#8217; War.&#8221; There, though the General complains of the
hardships endured by women and children, he can offer no suggestion
as to how these sufferings might have been averted. On May 16
General Botha is reported to have said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Throughout this war the presence of the women has caused me anxiety
and much distress. At first I managed to get them into the townships, but
later on this became impossible because the English refused to receive them.
I then conceived the idea of getting a few of our burghers to surrender and
sending the women in with them.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 29th of May, General De Wet, speaking in favour of
continuing the war, said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am asked what I mean to do with the women and children. That is a
very difficult question to answer. We must have faith. I think also we might
meet the emergency in this way. A part of the men should be told off to lay
down their arms for the sake of the women, and then they could take the
women with them to the English in the towns.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Later, General Botha said:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the war began we had plenty of provisions, and a commando
could remain weeks in one spot without the local supply running out. Our
families, too, were then well provided for. But now all is changed. One is
only too thankful nowadays to know that our wives are under English protection.
The question of our women folk is one of our greatest difficulties. What
are we to do with them? One man answers that some of the burghers should
surrender themselves to the English and take the women with them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>It is gratifying to note how the horrible charges of barbarity,
brought by persons ignorant of the real state of affairs in South
Africa at the time of the war, are disposed of by this one sentence
from the mouth of General Botha, &#8220;One is only too thankful nowadays
to know that our wives are under English protection.&#8221; We
owe General De Wet some gratitude for his book, bitter as it is,
since he makes evident that a main reason for the surrender of
May 31 was to ensure the safety of the women who were not in
the concentration camps, and whom they feared could not be placed
in those positions of security. It is plain that if the Boers could
have charged the British Government with the protection of those
women they would have held out for some time longer. In discussing
the question of the destruction done, we have only again to
turn to General De Wet&#8217;s history to discover how necessary was
the burning of certain farms which, worked by Kaffirs under the
direction of the women, were provision bases of the Boers; and
how imperative too was the shooting of horses, since, to quote the
General himself, the Boer is only half a man without his horse.
Indeed, though De Wet complains of the methods of the British in
carrying on the war, his own narration of his exploits&mdash;the wrecking
of trains, the destruction of railways, the burnings of the veldt, and
the stripping of prisoners&mdash;offers the &#8220;best explanation yet published
of the necessity for the measures of which he complains.&#8221;</p>

<p>To return to General Botha. In reply to Mr. Chamberlain he
wrote from Horrex&#8217;s Hotel, Norfolk Street, Strand, on the 12th of
November, stating:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;... That there were some misunderstandings as to the reasons which led to
the appeal to the world on behalf of their fellow-countrymen, which he wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to try to remove. In the first place, however, he sincerely shared Mr. Chamberlain&#8217;s
desire to avoid controversy, the more so as there were some assurances
in the Colonial Secretary&#8217;s recent speech&mdash;which he (General Botha)
was privileged to hear&mdash;of a kind to gratify all who had the fortunes of his
destitute fellow-countrymen at heart. He wished also to say that he and his
colleagues welcomed Mr. Chamberlain&#8217;s decision to visit South Africa, and
his determination to see the condition of their country with his own eyes, and
form a first-hand judgment on its needs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Dealing then with the &#8220;misunderstandings&#8221; which he wished to
remove, General Botha wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We made no secret in accepting the Terms of Surrender that the compensation
or assistance therein promised would be totally inadequate to enable the
Burghers of the late Republics who remained in the field or were in the
prisons and concentration camps to make a fair start in life again. On the
contrary it was made clear by us that in the absence of further help from the
British Government we would have at once to appeal to the charity of the
civilised world for further help for the widows and orphans of our Burghers,
and for those who had been rendered unfit for work by wounds or sickness
during the war....</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only from your speech of November 5th that we learnt that the
grant was intended entirely for all who are destitute, or who cannot make a
fresh start in life without help. We always understood that the £3,000,000
were to be given in partial compensation for war losses, and that that was also
understood by Lord Milner is clear from his despatch of June 11th (published
in Blue Book, Cd. 1163, page 141), in which he expresses his intention of
distributing it <i>pro rata</i> to those who can prove losses through the war.</p>

<p>&#8220;It therefore appeared to us that the free grant made no general provision
for widows, orphans, and the destitute except in so far as they could prove war
losses, and we distinctly gathered from your remarks that you could do no
more for them. Under these circumstances we issued our appeal. We were,
I need not say, highly gratified to learn from your recent speech that the
Government would undertake a fuller responsibility for those needing their
help, and particularly for the information that if more money than has been
voted should be needed, the loan would be increased accordingly. We feel
sure that it will ultimately be found that the £3,000,000 already assigned will
by no means suffice to meet what is required as a free gift. Meanwhile, the
needs of the sufferers are pressing, and we are glad to think that the sums
which, through the generosity of the public, we have been able to collect, will
to some extent minister to them without any delay, while they will also supplement
what is being done by the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;In regard to the loan, the provision lately made and the promise that the
amount would be augmented if necessary came as a great relief after the
months of waiting and suspense, when we were continually being told of those
who, from lack of timely assistance, were compelled to part with their property
to meet the urgent wants of themselves and their families. Some further and
more detailed information as to the terms and conditions under which loans
will be obtainable would be gratefully welcomed by the people interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;With regard to your reference to the free grant of three millions as something
&#8216;without any precedent in the history of the world,&#8217; I wish to say nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that can excite or prolong controversy. You must only allow me to remark
that the whole circumstances are unprecedented; that the gift of £3,000,000
was one of the conditions upon which the burghers laid down their arms; and
that our view is, that having taken the assets of our Governments, you may
fairly be expected to meet their liabilities, not in part, but in full.</p>

<p>&#8220;In regard to the large sums of money alleged by you to remain unexpended
in Europe out of sums remitted by the Transvaal to Europe during the
war, I can only assure you that I have no knowledge of any such remittances,
and should be surprised to find that any were made. There is no sum of
money belonging to the late Government known to me over which I have any
authority whatever. I can only say that should any such sums exist I personally
should be very glad to see them devoted to the objects mentioned.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Passing to the subject of the concentration camps, General Botha
said it was not his intention in the references he had made to them
to suggest that they ought to be broken up before the people could
be brought back to their farms. He proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We recognise that towards the close of the war improvements were introduced
into them, in consequence of which the death-rate fell to an ordinary
figure; but we do not know on what grounds you asserted that a death-rate of
21 per 1000 was lower than that which obtained before the war in normal
conditions, and we are not prepared to agree that that was the case. My
remark at Paris about the sufferings of the women and children had reference
more particularly to those remaining outside the camps, who had their dwellings,
with the furniture, food, and all that they contained, burnt or destroyed
by British troops; their herds killed or removed, and themselves left destitute on
the veldt. These were certainly sufferings, and they did carry great weight
with us, among other reasons, in inducing us to surrender.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>While admitting that the Government was making great efforts
to carry on the work of education in the camps, General Botha said
he could not help sharing with his colleagues many objections to
the large orphanages which had been referred to. He also wished
to point out with reference to the pecuniary and other assistance
given to the Boers in their misfortunes by &#8220;foreign&#8221; sympathisers,
that in cash and in kind they totalled a value more than a hundredfold
what Mr. Chamberlain had been led to suppose. On the subject
of the desolation caused by the war, General Botha continued:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;You are about to proceed to South Africa yourself, and if&mdash;as I have
no reason to doubt will be the case&mdash;you get some of our own people to go
over the country of the late Republics with you, you will be able to judge for
yourself whether the description of the ruin and desolation as given by myself
and others of us was&mdash;nay, I might almost say, if it could be&mdash;exaggerated....
If your allusion to &#8216;one or other of the belligerents&#8217; is meant to suggest that
the destruction of houses was practised by us you have been misinformed.
My orders were definite that no houses should be destroyed; I know of only
four cases where the orders were contravened, and in those instances every
endeavour was made to trace the perpetrators, and where known they were
promptly punished.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>General Botha further stated that he had no definite information
relative to the increase in the selling value of the land, but the
figures quoted showed to any one who knew the country before the
war the fearful loss which had taken place in cattle, sheep, and
horses. He concluded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I regret to have to dwell on these points, and have done so only to
remove misunderstandings as to the grounds for our appeal for aid. I do
not doubt your desire to restore peace and the elements of prosperity to our
unhappy country, and I would wish that we might so far as possible avoid
controversy as to the past, and address ourselves entirely to the necessities of
the present.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>To this letter Mr. Chamberlain replied, on the 15th of November,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th
of November, in reply to my comments on statements contained in the
&#8216;Appeal of the Boer Generals to the Civilised World,&#8217; and in their speeches
on the Continent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciate the spirit of the last paragraph of your letter, and share the
wish which you express therein, and in view of my approaching visit to South
Africa I will not prolong the present correspondence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust that during my tour I may gain much valuable information which
will assist his Majesty&#8217;s Government in their efforts to restore peace and
prosperity to the countries which have suffered by the war.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On the 18th of November, General Botha wrote the following
answer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have to thank you for your letter of 15th instant, and wish only
to say, in reply, that I cordially join in the hope that your visit to South
Africa may be a step towards that restoration of peace and prosperity to our
desolate country, which I am sure that it is your desire to promote.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
